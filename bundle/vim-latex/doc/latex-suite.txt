                                    Abstract
                                    ========
Latex-Suite attempts to provide a comprehensive set of tools to view, edit and
compile LaTeX documents in Vim. Together, they provide tools starting from
macros to speed up editing LaTeX documents to functions for forward searching
.dvi documents. Latex-Suite has been possible because of the contributions of
many people. Please see latex-suite-credits [|ls_a_dU|] for a list of people who
have helped.

Viewing this file

This file can be viewed with all the sections and subsections folded to ease
navigation. By default, vim does not fold help documents. To create the folds,
press za now. The folds are created via a foldexpr which can be seen in the
last section of this file.

See |usr_28.txt| for an introduction to folding and |fold-commands| for key
sequences and commands to work with folds.

Installation and recommended Settings                           *ls_1* *ls_a_bc*
                                                          *recommended-settings*



If you are reading this, it most probably means that you have already installed
Latex-Suite and the help files. If this is not the case, follow the detailed
instructions on Latex-Suite's download page |ls_u_2|.

Make sure that you create a few necessary settings in your ~/.vimrc.  >
    
    " REQUIRED. This makes vim invoke Latex-Suite when you open a tex file.
    filetype plugin on
    
    " IMPORTANT: win32 users will need to have 'shellslash' set so that latex
    " can be called correctly.
    set shellslash
    
    " IMPORTANT: grep will sometimes skip displaying the file name if you
    " search in a singe file. This will confuse Latex-Suite. Set your grep
    " program to always generate a file-name.
    set grepprg=grep\ -nH\ $*
    
    " OPTIONAL: This enables automatic indentation as you type.
    filetype indent on
    
    " OPTIONAL: Starting with Vim 7, the filetype of empty .tex files defaults to
    " 'plaintex' instead of 'tex', which results in vim-latex not being loaded.
    " The following changes the default filetype back to 'tex':
    let g:tex_flavor='latex'
    


In addition, the following settings could go in your ~/.vim/ftplugin/tex.vim
file:  >
    " this is mostly a matter of taste. but LaTeX looks good with just a bit
    " of indentation.
    set sw=2
    " TIP: if you write your \label's as \label{fig:something}, then if you
    " type in \ref{fig: and press <C-n> you will automatically cycle through
    " all the figure labels. Very useful!
    set iskeyword+=:

Inserting Templates                                             *ls_2* *ls_a_bd*
                                                         *latex-suite-templates*



This functionality is available via the TeX-Suite > Templates menu. This module
provides a way to insert custom templates at the beginning of the current file.

When Latex-Suite first starts up, it scans the
$VIM/ftplugin/latex-suite/templates/ directory and creates menu items based on
the files found there. When you select a template from this menu, the file will
be read in above the first line of the current file.

A template file can utilize placeholders for initializing the cursor position
when the template is read in and subsequent movement. In addition, template
files can contain dynamic elements such as the time of creation of a file etc,
by using vim expressions.

You can place your own templates in the $VIM/ftplugin/latex-suite/templates/
directory in order for them to be available via the menu. Unless Latex-Suite
releases a template with the same name, these files should not get over-written
when you install a new release over an existing one.

NOTE: Templates are also accessible for non-gui users with the command
      |:TTemplate|. The argument should be name of the corresponding template
      file. If the command is called without arguments (preferred usage), then a
      list of available templates is displayed and the user is asked to choose
      one of them.

Latex-Suite ships with a very comprehensive set of insert mode and |visual-mode|
mappings and menu items to typeset most of the LaTeX elements.

NOTE: These mappings are are not standard mappings in the sense that only the
      last character is mapped. See plugin/imaps.vim for further documentation.
      For example, in the case of the mapping EFI provided by Latex-Suite you
      can press the characters 'E', 'F' and 'I' as slowly as you wish (unlike
      the normal imap command where timeout issues are involved). The characters
      are visible as you type them (unlike normal imaps) and you can use the
      movement or backspace key to correct yourself unlike normal mappings.
      
      
                                                        *place-holder* *ls_a_dV*

NOTE: Place Holders
      -------------
      Almost all macros provided in Latex-Suite implement Stephen Riem's
      bracketing system and Gergely Kontra's JumpFunc() for handling
      place-holders. This consists of using "place-holders" to mark off
      locations where the next relevant editing has to be done. As an example,
      when you type EFI in |insert-mode|, you will get the following:  >
          \begin{figure}[h]
              \centerline{\psfig{figure=<+eps file+>}}
              \caption{<+caption text+>}
              \label{fig:<+label+>}
          \end{figure}<++>
<     The text <+eps file+> will be selected and you will be left in
      |select-mode| so that you can continue typing straight away. After having
      typed in the file name, you can press <Ctrl-J> (while still in
      insert-mode). This will take you directly to the next "place-holder". i.e,
      <+caption text+> will be visually selected with Vim in select mode again
      for typing in the caption. This saves on a lot of key presses.
      
      
                                                   *overriding-macros* *ls_a_eE*
NOTE: Over-riding Latex-Suite Macros
      ------------------------------
      If you wish to change these macros from their default values, for example,
      if you wish to change `w to expand to \omega instead of its default
      expansion to \wedge, you should use the IMAP function as described in the
      Using IMAP() [|ls_a_bG|] section.
      
      An important thing to note is that if you wish to over-ride macros created
      by Latex-Suite rather than merely create new macros, you should place the
      IMAP() calls in a script which gets sourced after the files in
      Latex-Suite. A good place typically is as a file-type plugin file in the
      ~/.vim/after/ftplugin/ directory. (Use ~/vimfiles if you are using
      WINDOWS). For example to over-ride `w to \omega instead of \wedge, place
      the following line in (say) ~/.vim/after/ftplugin/tex_macros.vim:  >
          call IMAP('`w', '\omega', 'tex')
<     
      
      NOTE: It is important to use a file-name which will get sourced on a
            FileType event. Therefore you must use a file-name which conforms to
            the standards as described in |ftplugin-name|.
            
            
      
                                                       *pausing-imaps* *ls_a_eF*
NOTE: Pausing Macro expansion
      -----------------------
      If you wish to temporarily suspend the imaps functionality, then you can
      set the Imap_FreezeImap to 1. If you set g:Imap_FreezeImap to 1, then it
      will be a system-wide setting. Setting b:Imap_FreezeImap will affect only
      the current buffer.
      
      
The following sections describe the various editing macros provided by
Latex-Suite.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Environment Mappings                                          *ls_3_1* *ls_a_bf*
                                                          *environment-mappings*

Latex-Suite provides a rich set of mappings to insert, enclose and modify LaTeX
environments, i.e, \begin{...} ... \end{...} pairs.

Inserting Environments                                      *ls_3_1_1* *ls_a_bg*
                                                        *inserting-environments*

Latex-Suite provides the following ways to insert environments



Method 1: Pressing <F5>                                   *ls_3_1_1_1* *ls_a_bh*
                                                              *inserting-env-f5*

If you press <F5> in the insert or normal mode while on an empty line,
Latex-Suite prompts you with a list of environments you might want to insert.
You can either choose one from the list or type in a new environment name. If
you press <F5> on a line which already has a word, then that word is used
instead of prompting.

See Tex_Env_name [|ls_a_cZ|] for a description of how Latex-Suite uses the word
to form the expansion and how to modify Latex-Suite's behavior.

The list of environments which Latex-Suite prompts you with (when <F5> is
pressed on an empty line) is formed from the Tex_PromptedEnvironments
[|ls_a_di|] setting.

In addition to this setting, Latex-Suite also lists environments found in custom
packages as described in the section Package actions. [|ls_a_bL|]


Method 2: Using <S-F1>-<S-F4>                             *ls_3_1_1_2* *ls_a_bi*
                                                        *inserting-env-shift-f1*

The shifted function keys, <S-F1> to <S-F4> can be mapped to insert very
commonly used environments. The environments mapped to each key can be
customized via the g:Tex_HotKeyMappings [|ls_a_dj|] setting.


Method 3: Using three letter sequences                    *ls_3_1_1_3* *ls_a_bj*
                                                     *inserting-env-threeletter*

Environments can also be inserted by pressing a 3 capital letter sequence
starting with an E. The sequence of 3 letters generally tries to follow the
following rules:


1. All environment mappings begin with E

2. If the environment can be broken up into 2 distinct words, such as flushright
   (flush + right), then the next 2 letters are the first letters of the 2
   words. Example:  >
       flushleft  (_f_lush + _l_eft)  ---> EFL
       flushright (_f_lush + _r_ight) ---> EFR
       eqnarray   (_e_qn + _a_rray)   ---> EEA
<  If on the other hand, the environment name cannot be broken up into 2
   distinct words, then the next 2 letters are the first 2 letters of the name
   of the environment. Example:  >
       equation (_eq_uation)          ---> EEQ
<  
Unfortunately there are some environments that cannot be split in two words and
first two letters in name are identical. In this case shortcut is created from
E, first and last letter. Example:  >
    quote     (_q_uot_e_)          ---> EQE
    quotation (_q_uotatio_n_)      ---> EQN
Of course, not every last one of the environments can follow this rule because
of ambiguities. In case of doubt, pull down the Tex-Environments menu. The menu
item should give the hint for the map.


Enclosing in Environments                                   *ls_3_1_2* *ls_a_bk*
                                                        *enclosing-environments*

Latex-Suite provides visual-mode mappings which enclose visually selected
portions of text in environments. There are two ways provided to do this.



Method 1: Pressing <F5>                                   *ls_3_1_2_1* *ls_a_bl*
                                                              *enclosing-env-f5*

You can also select a portion of text visually and press <F5> while still in
visual mode. This will prompt you with a list of environments. (This list can be
customized via the g:Tex_PromptedEnvironments [|ls_a_di|] setting). You can
either choose from this list or type in a new environment name. Once the
selection is done, Latex-Suite encloses the visually selected portion in the
chosen environment.


Method 2: Using three letter mappings                     *ls_3_1_2_2* *ls_a_bm*
                                                     *enclosing-env-threeletter*

You can also select text visually and press a sequence of three characters
beginning with , (the single comma character) and the selected text will be
enclosed in the chosen environment. The three letter sequence follows directly
from the three letter sequence used to insert environments as described here
[|ls_a_bj|]. The following example describes the rule used:

If ECE inserts a \begin{center}...\end{center} environment, then to enclose a
block of selected text in \begin{center}...\end{center}, simply select the text
and press ,ce. The rule simply says that the leading E is converted to , and the
next 2 letters are small case.
Some of the visual mode mappings are sensitive to whether you choose line-wise
or character-wise. For example, if you choose a word and press ,ce, then you get
\centerline{word}, whereas if you press ,ce on a line-wise selection, you get:  >
    \begin{center}
        line
    \end{center}



Changing Environments                                       *ls_3_1_3* *ls_a_bn*
                                                         *changing-environments*

Pressing <S-F5> in normal mode detects which environment the cursor is presently
located in and prompts you to replace it with a new one. The innermost
environment is detected. For example, in the following source:  >
    \begin{eqnarray}
      \begin{array}{ccc}
        2 & 3 & 4
      \end{array}
    \end{eqnarray}
if you are located in the middle "2 & 3 & 4" line, then pressing <S-F5> will
prompt you to change the array environment, not the eqnarray environment. In
addition, Latex-Suite will also try to change lines within the environment to be
consistent with the new environment. For example, if the original environment
was an eqnarray environment with a \label command, then changing it to an
eqnarray* environment will delete the \label.

Pressing <F5> in normal mode has the same effect as pressing <F5> in
insert-mode, namely you will be prompted to choose an environment to insert.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Command Mappings                                              *ls_3_2* *ls_a_bo*
                                                            *latex-command-maps*

Latex-Suite provides a rich set of mappings to insert, enclose and modify LaTeX
commands.

Inserting LaTeX commands                                    *ls_3_2_1* *ls_a_bp*
                                                            *inserting-commands*

                                                          *ls-imap-f7* *ls_a_dW*
                                                        *ls-imap-s-f7* *ls_a_dX*
Pressing <F7> in insert or normal mode while the cursor is touching a word will
insert a command formed from the word touching the cursor.

For certain common commands, Latex-Suite will expand them to include additional
arguments as needed. For example, frac becomes \frac{<++>}{<++>}<++>. Otherwise,
it will simply change the word under the cursor as follows  >
    word --> \word{<++>}<++>
You can define custom expansions of commands using the Tex_Com_{name} setting as
described in here [|ls_a_da|].

If <F7> is pressed when the cursor is on white-space, then Latex-Suite will
prompt you to choose a command and insert that instead.The list of commands is
constructed from the g:Tex_PromptedCommands [|ls_a_dk|] setting and also from
commands which Latex-Suite finds while scanning custom packages which
Latex-Suite finds. See the Package actions [|ls_a_bL|] section for details on
which files are scanned etc.


Enclosing in a command                                      *ls_3_2_2* *ls_a_bq*
                                                            *enclosing-commands*

You can select a portion of text visually and press <F7> while still in visual
mode. This will prompt you with a list of commands. (This list can be customized
via the g:Tex_PromptedCommands [|ls_a_dk|] setting). You can either choose from
this list or type in a new command name. Once the selection is done, Latex-Suite
encloses the visually selected portion in the chosen command.


Changing commands                                           *ls_3_2_3* *ls_a_br*
                                                             *changing-commands*

                                                          *ls-vmap-f7* *ls_a_dY*
In both insert and normal mode <S-F7> will find out if you are presently within
an environment and then prompt you with a list of commands to change it to.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Font Mappings                                     *ls_3_3* *ls_a_bs* *font-maps*

These mappings insert font descriptions such as: \textsf{<++>}<++> with the
cursor left in place of the first placeholder [|ls_a_eD|] (the <++> characters).

Mnemonic:
1. first letter is always F (F for font)

2. next 2 letters are the 2 letters describing the font.

Example: Typing FEM in insert-mode expands to \emph{<++>}<++>.

Just like environment mappings, you can visually select an area and press `sf to
have it enclosed in: \textsf{word} or  >
    {\sffamily
    line
    }
depending on character-wise or line-wise selection.

Section Mappings                                              *ls_3_4* *ls_a_bt*
                                                              *section-mappings*

These maps insert LaTeX sections such as:  >
    \section{<++>}<++>
etc. Just as in the case of environments and fonts, can be enclosed with a
visual selection. The enclosing is not sensitive to character or line-wise
selection.

Mnemonic: (make your own!)  >
    SPA for part
    SCH for chapter
    SSE for section
    SSS for subsection
    SS2 for subsubsection
    SPG for paragraph
    SSP for subparagraph


Example: SSE in insert mode inserts  >
    \section{<++>}<++>
If you select a word or line and press ,se, then you get  >
    \section{section name}
The menu item in Tex-Environments.Sections have a sub-menu called 'Advanced'.
Choosing an item from this sub-menu asks a couple of questions (whether you want
to include the section in the table of contents, whether there is a shorter name
for the table of contents) and then creates a more intelligent template.

Greek Letter Mappings                                         *ls_3_5* *ls_a_bu*
                                                         *greek-letter-mappings*

Lower case

`a through `z expand to \alpha through \zeta.Upper case:

  >
    `D = \Delta
    `F = \Phi
    `G = \Gamma
    `Q = \Theta
    `L = \Lambda
    `X = \Xi
    `Y = \Psi
    `S = \Sigma
    `U = \Upsilon
    `W = \Omega
NOTE: LaTeX does not support upper case for all greek alphabets.
      
      
Just like other Latex-Suite mappings, these mappings are not created using the
standard imap command. Thus you can type slowly, correct using <BS> etc.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Auc-Tex Key Bindings                                          *ls_3_6* *ls_a_bv*
                                                              *auc-tex-mappings*

These are simple 2 key expansions for some very commonly used LaTeX elements:

  >
    `^   Expands To   \Hat{<++>}<++>
    `_   expands to   \bar{<++>}<++>
    `6   expands to   \partial
    `8   expands to   \infty
    `/   expands to   \frac{<++>}{<++>}<++>
    `%   expands to   \frac{<++>}{<++>}<++>
    `@   expands to   \circ
    `0   expands to   ^\circ
    `=   expands to   \equiv
    `\   expands to   \setminus
    `.   expands to   \cdot
    `*   expands to   \times
    `&   expands to   \wedge
    `-   expands to   \bigcap
    `+   expands to   \bigcup
    `(   expands to   \subset
    `)   expands to   \supset
    `<   expands to   \le
    `>   expands to   \ge
    `,   expands to   \nonumber
    `~   expands to   \tilde{<++>}<++>
    `;   expands to   \dot{<++>}<++>
    `:   expands to   \ddot{<++>}<++>
    `2   expands to   \sqrt{<++>}<++>
    `|   expands to   \Big|
    `I   expands to   \int_{<++>}^{<++>}<++>
(again, notice the convenient place-holders)

In addition the visual mode macros are provided:

  >
    `(  encloses selection in \left( and \right)
    `[  encloses selection in \left[ and \right]
    `{  encloses selection in \left\{ and \right\}
    `$  encloses selection in $$ or \[ \] depending on characterwise or
                                          linewise selection

Diacritics                                                    *ls_3_7* *ls_a_bw*
                                                            *diacritic-mappings*

These mappings speed up typing European languages which contain diacritic
characters such as a-umlaut etc.  >
    +<l>     expands to \v{<l>}
    =<l>     expands to \'{<l>}
where <l> is an alphabet.

  >
    +}       expands to \"{a}
    +:       expands to \^{o}
Latex-Suite also ships with smart backspacing [|ls_a_dZ|] functionality which
provides another convenience while editing languages with diacritics.

NOTE: Diacritics are disabled by default in Latex-Suite because they can
      sometimes be a little too intrusive. Moreover, most European users can
      nowadays use font encodings which display diacritic characters directly
      instead of having to rely on Latex-Suite's method of displaying
      diacritics.
      
      Set the g:Tex_Diacritics [|ls_a_df|] variable to enable diacritics.

BibTeX Shortcuts                                              *ls_3_8* *ls_a_bx*
                                                               *bibtex-bindings*

Latex-Suite provides an easy way of entering bibliographic entries. Four
insert-mode mappings: BBB, BBL, BBH and BBX are provided, all of which
essentially act in the same manner. When you type any of these in insert-mode,
you will get a prompt asking you to choose a entry type for the bibliographic
entry.

When you choose an entry type, a bibliographic entry template will be inserted.
For example, if you choose the option 'book' via the map BBB, then the following
template will be inserted:  >
    @BOOK{<+key+>,
        author = {<++>},
        editor = {<++>},
        title = {<++>},
        publisher = {<++>},
        year = {<++>},
        otherinfo = {<++>}
    }<++>


<+key+> will be highlighted in select-mode and you can type in the bib-key.
After that you can use <Ctrl-J> to navigate to successive locations in the
template and enter new values.

BBB inserts a template with only the fields mandatorily required for a given
entry type. BBL inserts a template with commonly used extra options. BBH inserts
a template with more options which are not as commonly used. BBX inserts a
template with all the fields which the entry type supports.

NOTE: Mnemonic
      --------
      B for Bibliographic entry, L for Large entry, H for Huge entry, and X
      stands for all eXtras.
      
      


Customizing Bib-TeX fields                                  *ls_3_8_1* *ls_a_by*
                                                            *adding-bib-options*

If you wish the BBB command to insert a few additional fields in addition to the
fields it creates, then you will need to define global variables of the form  >
    g:Bib_{type}_options
in you $VIM/ftplugin/bib.vim file, where {type} is a string like 'article',
'book' etc. This variable should contain one of the letters defined in the
following table

Character    Field Type~
w            address
a            author
b            booktitle
c            chapter
d            edition
e            editor
h            howpublished
i            institution
k            isbn
j            journal
m            month
z            note
n            number
o            organization
p            pages
q            publisher
r            school
s            series
t            title
u            type
v            volume
y            year

For example, by default, choosing 'article' via BBB inserts the following
template by default  >
    @ARTICLE{<+key+>,
        author = {<++>},
        title = {<++>},
        journal = {<++>},
        year = {<++>},
        otherinfo = {<++>}
    }<++>
However, if g:Bib_article_options is defined as 'mnp', then 'article' will
insert the following template  >
    @ARTICLE{<+key+>,
        author = {<++>},
        title = {<++>},
        journal = {<++>},
        year = {<++>},
        month = {<++>},
        number = {<++>},
        pages = {<++>},
        otherinfo = {<++>}
    }<++>


If you have some other fields you wish to associate with an article which are
not listed above, then you will have to use the Bib_{type}_extrafields option.
This is a newline separated string of complete field names which will be
included in the template. For example, if you define  >
    let g:Bib_article_extrafields = "crossref\nabstract"
then the article template will include the lines  >
    crossref = {<++>},
    abstract = {<++>},


NOTE: You will need to define Bib_* settings in your
      $VIMRUNTIME/ftplugin/bib.vim file.

Smart Key Mappings                                            *ls_3_9* *ls_a_bz*
                                                                    *smart-keys*

Latex-Suite ships with the following smart keys:

Smart Backspace
---------------
                                                     *smart-backspace* *ls_a_dZ*
Pressing <BS> in insert mode checks to see whether we are just after something
like \'{a} and if so, deletes all of it. i.e, diacritics are treated as single
characters for backspacing.

Smart Quotes
------------
Pressing " (English double quote) will insert `` or '' by making an intelligent
guess about whether we intended to open or close a quote.

Smart Space
-----------
Latex-Suite maps the <space> key in such a way that $ characters are not broken
across lines. It does this by first setting tw=0 so that Vim will not
automatically break lines and then maps the <space> key to insert newlines
keeping $$'s on the same line.

Smart Dots
----------
Pressing ... (3 dots) results in \ldots outside math mode and \cdots in math
mode.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alt Key Macros                                               *ls_3_10* *ls_a_bA*
                                                               *altkey-mappings*

Latex-Suite utilizes a set of macros originally created by Carl Mueller in
auctex.vim to make inserting all the \left ... \right stuff very easy and to
also make some use of the heavily under-utilized <Alt> key.

NOTE: By default, typing Alt-<key> in Vim takes focus to the menu bar if a menu
      with the hotkey <key> exists. If in your case, there are conflicts due to
      this behavior, you will need to set  >
          set winaltkeys=no
<     in your $VIM/ftplugin/tex.vim in order to use these maps.
      
      
NOTE: Customizing the maps
      --------------------
      If for some reason, you wish to not map the <Alt> keys, (some European
      users need to use the <Alt> key to enter diacritics), you can change these
      maps to other keys as described in the section Customizing Alt-key maps
      [|ls_a_cx|].
      
      


<Alt-L>                                            *ls_3_10_1* *ls_a_bB* *Alt-L*

This is a polymorphic insert-mode mapping which expands to one of the following
depending on the character just before the cursor location.

Character before cursor    Expansion~
(                          \left( <++> \right)
[                          \left[ <++> \right]
|                          \left| <++> \right|
{                          \left\{ <++> \right\}
<                          \langle <++> \rangle
q                          \lefteqn{<++>}<++>

If the character before the cursor is none of the above, then it will simply
insert a \label{<++>}<++>.


<Alt-B>                                            *ls_3_10_2* *ls_a_bC* *Alt-B*

This insert-mode mapping encloses the previous character in \mathbf{}.


<Alt-C>                                            *ls_3_10_3* *ls_a_bD* *Alt-C*

In insert mode, this key is polymorphic as follows:


1. If the previous character is a letter or number, then capitalize it and
   enclose it in \mathcal{}.

2. otherwise insert \cite{}.
In visual mode, it will simply enclose the selection in \mathcal{}


<Alt-I>                                            *ls_3_10_4* *ls_a_bE* *Alt-I*

This mapping inserts an \item command at the current cursor location depending
on which environment the cursor is enclosed in. The style of the \item command
is dependent on the enclosing environment. By default, <Alt-I> has styles
defined forthe following environments:

Environment        Style~
itemize            \item
enumerate          \item
theindex           \item
thebibliography    \item[<+biblabel+>]{<+bibkey+>} <++>
description        \item[<+label+>] <++>

<Alt-I> is intelligent enough to account for nested environments. For example,  >
    \begin{itemize}
        \item first item
        \item second item
              \begin{description}
                  \item[label1] first desc
                  \item[label2] second
                  % <Alt-I> will insert "\item[<+label+>] <++>" if
                  % used here
              \end{description}
        \item third item
        % <Alt-I> will insert "\item " when if used here.
    \end{itemize}
    % <Alt-I> will insert nothing ("") if used here
<

The style used by <Alt-I> can be customized using the
g:Tex_ItemStyle_environment [|ls_a_dl|] variable.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Custom Macros                                                *ls_3_11* *ls_a_bF*
                                                            *custom-macros-menu*

This functionality available via the TeX-Suite.Macros menu, provides a way of
inserting customized macros into the current file via the menu.

When Latex-Suite starts up, it scans the $VIM/ftplugin/latex-suite/macros/
directory and creates a menu from the files found there. Each file is considered
as a single macro. You can place your own macros in this directory, using
placeholders [|ls_a_eD|] if wanted.

When you choose a macro from the menu, the corresponding file is read into the
current buffer after the current cursor position. In non-gui mode, you can use
the |TMacro| command instead of choosing from the menu. This command takes the
macro file name as an argument. When called without arguments (preferred usage),
then a list of available macro files is displayed and the user is prompted to
choose one of them).

There are some other tools provided in this menu, namely:


{New}       Creates a new (unnamed) buffer in the latex-suite/macros/ directory.
            Use the command :TexMacroNew in non-gui mode.
{Edit}      Opens up the corresponding macro file for editing. Use |:TexMacroEdit|
            in non-gui mode. When you try to edit {macro} not from local directory
            Latex-Suite will copy it to your local directory with suffix "-local".
            If local copy already exists Latex-Suite prompt for overwriting it.
{Delete}    Deletes the corresponding macro. Use the prefixed numbers for fast
            navigation of menus. Use |:TexMacroDelete| in non-gui mode. When you
            choose to delete {macro} which is not in your local directory
            Latex-Suite will refuse to delete it.
{Redraw}    Rescans the macros/ directories and refreshes the macros list.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Making your own Macros via IMAP()                            *ls_3_12* *ls_a_bG*
                                                                 *ls-new-macros*

If you find the need to create your own macros, then you can use the IMAP()
function provided with Latex-Suite. See [|ls_a_bH|] for a short explanation of
why you might prefer IMAP() over Vim's standard :imap command. An example best
explains the usage:  >
    :call IMAP('NOM', '\nomenclature{<++>}<++>', 'tex')
This will create a Latex-Suite-style mapping, where if you type NOM in insert
mode, you will get \nomenclature{<++>}<++> with the cursor left in place of the
first <++> characters. See [|ls_a_bI|] for a detailed explanation of the IMAP()
command.

For maps which are triggered for a given filetype, the IMAP() command above
should be put in the filetype plugin script for that file. For example, for
tex-specific mappings, the IMAP() calls should go in $VIM/ftplugin/tex.vim. For
globally visible maps, you will need to use the following in either your
~/.vimrc or a file in your $VIM/plugin directory.  >
    augroup MyIMAPs
        au!
        au VimEnter * call IMAP('Foo', 'foo', '')
    augroup END




Why use IMAP()                                             *ls_3_12_1* *ls_a_bH*
                                                                      *why-IMAP*

Using IMAP instead of Vim's built-in :imap command has a couple of advantages:
1. The 'ttimeout' option will generally limit how easily you can type the left
   hand side for a normal :imap. if you type the left hand side too slowly, then
   the mapping will not be activated.

2. If you mistype one of the letters of the lhs, then the mapping is deactivated
   as soon as you backspace to correct the mistake.

3. The characters in lhs are shown on top of each other. This is fairly
   distracting. This becomes a real annoyance when a lot of characters initiate
   mappings.


IMAP() syntax                                              *ls_3_12_2* *ls_a_bI*
                                                               *ls-imaps-syntax*

Formally, the syntax which is used for the IMAP function is:  >
    call IMAP (lhs, rhs, ft [, phs, phe])


Argument    Explanation~
lhs         This is the "left-hand-side" of the mapping. When you use IMAP, only
            the last character of this word is actually mapped, although the
            effect is that the whole word is mapped.
            
            If you have two mappings which end in a common lhs, then the mapping
            with the longer lhs is used. For example, if you do  >
                call IMAP('BarFoo', 'something', 'tex')
                call IMAP('Foo', 'something else', 'tex')
<           Then typing BarFoo inserts "something", whereas Foo by itself inserts
            "something else".
            
            Also, the nature of IMAP() makes creating certain combination of
            mappings impossible. For example if you have  >
                call IMAP('foo', 'something', 'tex')
                call IMAP('foobar', 'something else', 'tex')
<           Then you will never be able to trigger "foobar" because typing "foo"
            will immediately insert "something". This is the "cost" which you
            incur over the normal :imap command for the convenience of no
            'timeout' problems, the ability to correct lhs etc.
            
            
rhs         The "right-hand-side" of the mapping. This is the expansion you will
            get when you type lhs.
            
            This string can also contain special characters such as <enter> etc.
            To do this, you will need to specify the second argument in
            double-quotes as follows:  >
                :call IMAP('EFE', "\\begin{figure}\<CR><++>\\end{figure}<++>", 'tex')
<           With this, typing EFE is equivalent to typing in the right-hand side
            with all the special characters in insert-mode. This has the advantage
            that if you have filetype indentation set up, then the right hand side
            will also be indented just as if you had typed it in normally.
            
                                              *IMAP_PutTextWithMovement* *ls_a_ea*
            You can also set up a Latex-Suite style mapping which calls a custom
            function as follows:  >
                :call IMAP('FOO', "\<C-r>=MyFoonction()\<CR>", 'tex')
<           where MyFoonction is a custom function you have written. If
            MyFoonction also has to return a string containing <++> characters,
            then you will need to use the function IMAP_PutTextWithMovement(). An
            example best explains the usage:
            
              >
                call IMAP('FOO', "\<C-r>=AskVimFunc()\<CR>", 'vim')
                " Askvimfunc: Asks For Function Name And Sets Up Template 
                " Description: 
                function! AskVimFunc()
                    let name = input('Name of the function : ')
                    if name == ''
                        let name = "<+Function Name+>"
                    end
                    let islocal = input('Is this function scriptlocal ? [y]/n : ', 'y')
                    if islocal == 'y'
                        let sidstr = '<SID>'
                    else
                        let sidstr = ''
                    endif
                    return IMAP_PutTextWithMovement( 
                        \ "\" ".name.": <+short description+> \<cr>" .
                        \ "Description: <+long description+>\<cr>" . 
                        \ "\<C-u>function! ".name."(<+arguments+>)<++>\<cr>" . 
                        \       "<+function body+>\<cr>" . 
                        \ "endfunction \" "
                        \ )
                endfunction
<           
            
            
ft          The file type for which this mapping is active. When this string is
            left empty, the mapping applies for all file-types. A filetype
            specific mapping will always take precedence.
            
            
phs, phe    If you prefer to write the rhs with characters other than <+ and +> to
            denote place-holders, you can use the last 2 arguments to specify
            which characters in the rhs specify place-holders. By default, these
            are <+ and +> respectively.
            
            Note that the phs and phe arguments do not control what characters
            will be displayed for the placeholders when the mapping is actually
            triggered. What characters are used to display place-holders when you
            trigger an IMAP are controlled by the Imap_PlaceHolderStart
            [|ls_a_cV|] and Imap_PlaceHolderEnd [|ls_a_er|] settings.

Latex-Suite has a lot of functionality written to ease working with packages.
Packages here refers to files which you include into the LaTeX document using
the \usepackage command.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Inserting package commands                                    *ls_4_1* *ls_a_bK*
                                                            *inserting-packages*

When you first invoke Latex-Suite, it scans the
$VIM/ftplugin/latex-suite/packages directory for package script files and
creates a menu from all the files found there. This menu is created under
TeX-Suite > Packages > Supported. This menu contains a list of packages
"supported" by Latex-Suite. When you choose one of the packages from this menu
(for example the amsmath package), then a line of the form  >
    \usepackage[<++>]{amsmath}<++>
will be inserted into the current file.

The \usepackage line can also be inserted in an easy manner in the current file
by pressing <F5> while in the preamble of the current document. This will set up
a prompt from the supported packages and ask you to choose from one of them. If
you do not find the package you want to insert in the list, you can type in a
package-name and it will use that. Pressing <F5> in the preamble on a line
containing a single word will construct a \usepackage line from that word.

You can also use the TPackage [|ls_a_cD|] to insert the \usepackage line.

Once you have inserted a \usepackage line, for supported packages, you can use
the Options and Commands menus described in the next section [|ls_a_bL|].

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Actions taken for supported packages                          *ls_4_2* *ls_a_bL*
                                                               *package-actions*

Latex-Suite takes the following actions for packages detected when a file is
loaded, or a new \usepackage line is inserted using one of the methods described
in the previous section [|ls_a_bK|].

If you are using the GUI and you have g:Tex_Menus [|ls_a_dI|] set to 1,
Latex-Suite will create the following sub-menus
TeX-Suite > Packages > <package> Options

TeX-Suite > Packages > <package> Commands

where <package> is the package you just inserted (or was detected). You can use
these menus to insert commands, environments and options which Latex-Suite
recognizes as belonging to this package.

NOTE: While inserting an option, you need to position yourself in the
      appropriate place in the document, most commonly inside the square braces
      in the \usepackage[]{packname} command. Latex-Suite will not navigate to
      that location.
      
      
In addition to creating these sub-menus, Latex-Suite will also scan the
$VIM/ftplugin/latex-suite/dictionaries directory and if a dictionary file
corresponding to the package file is found, then it will add the file to the
'dict' setting in Vim so you can use the <C-X><C-K> command to complete words
from that file.

For example, the SIUnits package has a custom dictionary.

                                              *latex-package-scanning* *ls_a_eb*
If a package detected at startup is found by Latex-Suite in the current
directory or in a location specified by the g:Tex_TEXINPUTS [|ls_a_dT|]
variable, Latex-Suite will scan the package for \newenvironment and newcommand
lines and also append any commands and environments found to the list of
commands and environments which you are prompted with when you press <F5>
[|ls_a_bh|] or <F7> [|ls_a_dW|] in insert mode.
In addition, the TeX-Suite > Packages menu also contains the following submenus

Update
------
This command is to be invoked with the cursor placed on the package name. If the
corresponding package is found, then a sub-menu with the supported commands and
options is created.

Update All
----------
This function reads the preamble of the document for \usepackage lines and if
Latex-Suite supports the detected packages, then sub-menus containing the
package options and commands are created.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Automatic Package detection                                   *ls_4_3* *ls_a_bM*
                                                   *automatic-package-detection*

Whenever Latex-Suite begins editing a new LaTeX file, it scans it for
\usepackage{name} lines, and if a supported package is found, then it will
create sub-menus and add to the 'dict' setting as described above.

If a master-file [|ls_a_ct|] has been specified, then it will scan that file
instead of the current file. See the section Custom Packages [|ls_a_bN|] to see
which files Latex-Suite will scan in more detail.

For all the packages detected in this manner, Latex-Suite will take certain
actions as described in the section package support. [|ls_a_bL|].



Custom Packages                                             *ls_4_3_1* *ls_a_bN*
                                                               *custom-packages*

Often times, the preamble can become too long, and some people prefer to put
most of their personalization in a custom package and include that using a
\usepackage line. Latex-Suite tries to search such customs package for other
\usepackage lines, so that supported packages included in this indirect manner
can also be used to create sub-menus, extend the 'dict' setting etc. The most
obvious place to place such custom packages is in the same directory as the
edited file. In addition, LaTeX also supports placing custom packages in places
pointed to by the $TEXINPUTS environment variable.

If you use the $TEXINPUTS variable in LaTeX, and you wish Latex-Suite to search
these custom packages for \usepackage lines, then you need to initialize the
g:Tex_TEXINPUTS [|ls_a_dT|] variable.

The g:Tex_TEXINPUTS variable needs to be set in the same format which Vim uses
for the 'path' setting. This format is explained in detail if you do  >
    :help file-searching
from within Vim.

Therefore the value of g:Tex_TEXINPUTS will most probably be different from
$TEXINPUTS which your native LaTeX distribution uses.

Example:  >
    let g:Tex_TEXINPUTS = '~/texmf/mypackages/**,./**'
The ** indicates that all directories below the directory ~/texmf/mypackages and
./ are to be scanned for custom packages.

NOTE: The present directory '.' is always searched. You need not include that in
      g:Tex_TEXINPUTS.
      
      

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Writing supporting for a package                              *ls_4_4* *ls_a_bO*
                                                           *supporting-packages*

Supporting a package is easy and consists of writing a vim script with the same
name as the package and placing it in the $VIM/ftplugin/latex-suite/packages
directory. A package script should define two variables as described in the next
two sections. In addition to these two variables, you can also define any
functions, environment definitions etc. in this file.



g:Tex_package_option_<package>                              *ls_4_4_1* *ls_a_bP*

This setting is a string containing a comma separated list of options supported
by this package.

Example:  >
    g:Tex_package_option_mypack = 'opt1,opt2=,sbr:group1,opt3,opt4'
The = suffix means that the option takes a value. Use sbr:group name to separate
options into sub-menus. All successive options will be clubbed into the group1
sub-menu till the next sbr: option is encountered.


g:Tex_package_<package>                                     *ls_4_4_2* *ls_a_bQ*

  >
    
        g:TeX_package_<package> = "pre:Command,pre:Command1"
    More detailed example is in latex-suite/packages/exmpl file (slightly
    outdated).
    Here is short summary of prefixes which can be used in package files:
    (x - place with cursor, <++> - |placeholder|)
    
    {env:command}  Environment: creates simple environment template
                \begin{command}
                    x
                \end{command}<++>
    {eno:command}  Environment with option:
                \begin[x]{command}
                    <++>
                \end{command}<++>
    {ens:command[<<option>>]...}  Environment special:
                \begin[<<option>>]...{command}
                    <++>
                \end{command}<++>
    {bra:command} Brackets:
                \command{x}<++>
    {brd:command} Brackets double:
                \command{x}{<++>}<++>
    {brs:command[<<option>>]...} Brackets special (as environment special:
                \command[<+x+>]{<++>}{<++>}<++>
    {nor:command} Normal:
                \command<Space
    {noo:command} Normal with option:
                \command[x]<++>
    {nob:command} Normal with option and brackets:
                \command[x]{<++>}<++>
    {pla:command} Plain:
                command<Space
    {spe:command} Special:
                command   <-literal insertion of command
    {sep:command} creates separator. Good for aesthetics and usability :)
    {sbr:command} Breaks menu into submenus. <command> will be title of submenu.
                Can be used also in package variable.
    
    Command can be also given without prefix:. The result is
               \command

Latex Completion                                                *ls_5* *ls_a_bR*
                                                              *latex-completion*

|ls_5_1| Latex-Suite completion example
|ls_5_2| Latex-Suite \ref completion
|ls_5_3| Latex-Suite \cite completion
|ls_5_4| Latex-Suite filename completion
|ls_5_5| Custom command completion


Latex-Suite provides an easy way to insert references to labels and
bibliographic entries and also provide filename arguments to commands such as
\includegraphics. Although the completion capabilities are very diverse,
Latex-Suite only uses a single key (<F9> by default) to do all of it. Pressing
the <F9> key does different things based on where you are located. Latex-Suite
tries to guess what you might be trying to complete at the location where you
pressed <F9>. For example, pressing <F9> when you are within a \ref command will
try to list the \label's in the present directory. Pressing it when you are in a
\cite command will list bibliography keys. Latex-Suite also recognizes commands
which need a file name argument and will put up an explorer window for you to
choose a filename.

                                                      *ls-set-grepprg* *ls_a_eG*
NOTE: Before you start with Latex-Suite's completion function...
      ----------------------------------------------------------
      All of Latex-Suite's completion capabilities depend on a external program
      being available on your system which can search through a number of files
      for a reg-exp pattern. On *nix systems, the pre-installed grep utility is
      more than adequate. Most windows systems come with a utility findstr, but
      that has proven to be very inadequate (for one, it does not have an option
      to force the file name to be displayed when searching through a single
      file). Your best bet is to install cygwin |ls_u_3|, but if you think
      that's overkill, you can search for |ls_u_4| a windows implementation of
      GNU grep. (Latex-Suite testing on windows has been done with cygwin's port
      of GNU grep).
      
      Once you have a grep program installed, you need to set the 'grepprg'
      option for vim. Make sure you use a setting which forces the program to
      display file names even when you are searching through a single file. For
      GNU grep, the syntax is  >
          set grepprg=grep\ -nH\ $*
<

Consider the situation where you are editing a file with two equations labelled
eqn:euler and eqn:einstein. Now you want to insert a reference to one of these
equations. To do this, you type the \ref{eqn:} command and with the cursor
placed after eqn:, press <F9>. This will bring up two new windows beneath the
main window you were working in as shown in the figure below.  >
    
          8 These are a couple of equations:

         13 +--  4 lines: equation (eqn:einstein) :   E = m c^2---------------------

The first window (shown as [ErrorList] above) is a |cwindow| containing a list
of possible matches for the reference. The cursor will be located in the first
line of this window. The bottom window is a preview-window showing the context
of the \label. Moving around in the [ErrorList] window automatically scrolls the
preview window so as to always keep showing the context of the \label being
viewed in the [ErrorList] window. You can also press J and K in the [ErrorList]
window to scroll the preview window up and down.

To insert one of the labels, simply position the cursor in the correct line in
the [ErrorList] window and press <enter>. This will immediately close the two
newly opened windows, get back to the correct location in the original file
being edited and insert the label into the \ref command.

If you notice carefully in the example above, the [ErrorList] window only showed
the matches for the equations and did not list any of the figure labels. This is
because we pressed <F9> after \ref{eqn: instead of simply after \ref{. This
caused Latex-Suite to search only for those labels which started with the string
eqn:. If you had pressed <F9> after a \ref{, you would have been shown matches
from _all_ labels, not just those starting with eqn:.

Thus prefixing all your labels with eqn:, fig:, tab: etc. depending on what you
are labelling will lead to an easier time completing references.

Pressing <F9> when you are within a partially completed \ref command will split
open a window (named __OUTLINE__) which contains a nicely formatted list of all
the \labels found in the present project. The \labels are heirarchically
arranged according to which \section, \subsection etc of the overall document
structure they are present in. For example, when you first press <F9> after
typing \ref{, you should see something like:  >
    
    +-- 54 lines: 2. Kinematics--------------------------------
    +-- 98 lines: 3. Aerodynamics of the MFI thorax------------
    +-- 40 lines: 4. Jump Resonance in Fourbar Mechanisms------
    +-- 28 lines: 5. Design and Fabrication Issues-------------
        
Each chapter is |fold|ed away so that you can quickly jump to the correct
section/subsection in which the relevant equation is defined. This makes
inserting references significantly faster for large projects with hundreds of
equations. You can then open some of the folds to see for example:  >
    
    +-- 54 lines: 2. Kinematics--------------------------------
    3. Aerodynamics of the MFI thorax
        3.1. Aerodynamic modeling of the MFI wing forces
            3.1.1. Geometric Specification
                   eqn:wingnormal-pos
                     \nhat =  T_z(\theta_2) T_y(\theta_y)T_x(\theta_x)\nhat_0,
                   eqn:T-1
                     T_1(\theta_2) &=& T_z(\theta_2)
        
The <Tab> key is mapped in this window to toggle folds so that you can quickly
open/close folds in order to navigate the heirarchy faster. Once you are
positioned on a label, press <Enter>. This closes the __OUTLINE__ window,
returns to the window in which you pressed <F9> and inserts the reference at the
current cursor position.

NOTE: Filtering labels by prefix
      --------------------------
      You can press <F9> after typing part of the \label. In this case,
      Latex-Suite only presents \labels which begin with the already filled
      characters. You can use this to choose between equations, figures, tables
      etc. if you consistently label equations to begin with eqn:, figures to
      begin with fig: etc. For example, with this scheme, pressing <F9> after
      typing \ref{eqn: will only list equations.
      
      
NOTE: Latex-Suite works the same way if you press <F9> after any command which
      contains the letters ref. Thus you can complete \eqref in exactly the same
      manner.
      
      
NOTE: Requirements
      ------------
      This method of preseting the \labels depends on Vim being compiled with
      python support. To check if you have this, see the output of the :ver
      command. If you see something like +python, you are all set. Failing this,
      you will need to have python somewhere in your $PATH.

Latex-Suite provides an easy way to insert references to bibliographic entries.
Pressing <F9> when the cursor is placed inside a partially completed \cite
command will split open a new window (named __OUTLINE__) which contains a
formatted and syntax highlighted list of all bibtex entries found. For example,
pressing <F9> after typing \ref{ should present you with a window which looks
something like this:  >

You can easily jump from one entry to another using the 'n' and 'p' keys (to go
to the next / previous entry respectively).

You can also filter out a subset of the bibtex entries by pressing 'f' while in
this window. Doing this presents the following prompt:  >
    
    Field acronyms: (`:let g:Tex_EchoBibFields = 0` to avoid this message)
     [t] title         [a] author        [b] booktitle
     [j] journal       [y] year          [p] bibtype
     (you can also enter the complete field name)
    Enter filter criterion [field<space>value]:
        
At the prompt, type  >
    a ellington
Notice that the letter a is an acronym for author according to the prompt above.
Therefore this filter only shows those bibtex entries whose author field
contains the text ellington. You can keep narrowing your selection by repeatedly
filtering the results. If you would like to remove all the filters and see all
entries again, press 'a', which removes all the filters.

You can also sort the bibtex entries based on a field. To do this, press 's'.
This will present you with a prompt like in the case of the filter and you are
asked to choose a field. In this case, you would type in a single character.
This sorts the entries according to that field.

NOTE: <F9> will also work in a similar way after any command which contains the
      word cite in it. For example, pressing <F9> will also work with \citenum
      etc.
      
      
The following logic is applied to find out which bibliographic entries are
included in the completion.


1. Firstly, if the present file has a master-file [|ls_a_ct|] defined for it,
   then Latex-Suite will perform the following steps on that file instead of on
   the current file.

2. First, the file is scanned for a \bibliography command. To explain better,
   assume that a command  >
       \bibliography{file1,file2}
<  is found in the present file. For each bibliography file, say file1,
   Latex-Suite first tries to see if a .bib file, file1.bib can be found. If so,
   it will scan it for bib-keys of the form @BOOK{ etc., and add these searches
   to the completion list. If a .bib file cannot be found, then it will try to
   see if file1.bbl can be found. If so, Latex-Suite will search it for bib-keys
   of the form \bibitem and add these to the completion list.
   
   You can set the location where Latex-Suite will search for .bib and .bbl
   files using the |Tex_BIBINPUTS| [|ls_a_dr|] variable.

3. If a \bibliography command is not found, then Latex-Suite tries to scan the
   present file for a \begin{thebibliography} environment. If found, Latex-Suite
   searches the present file for bib-keys of the form \bibitem.

4. Finally, it will try to see if this file includes other files via the \input
   command. For each such file found, Latex-Suite will repeat the previous two
   steps stopping at the first file which has either a \bibliography command or
   a thebibliography environment.


Caching the \cite completion results                        *ls_5_3_1* *ls_a_bV*
                                                           *cite-search-caching*

                                                      *TClearCiteHist* *ls_a_ec*
Often times, the editing cycle proceeds by first laying out a comprehensive
bibliography and then completing all the \cite commands in one session. In such
situations, it is inefficient to scan the whole list of bibliography files for
bib-keys each time. Latex-Suite provides a way to cache the results of the cite
completion search using the Tex_RememberCiteSearch [|ls_a_du|] variable. If set,
Latex-Suite will perform the search only the first time <F9> is used. Next time
on, it will reuse the search results. If you wish to redo the search results,
issue the command  >
    TClearCiteHist
This will redo the completion list next time you use <F9>.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Latex-Suite filename completion                               *ls_5_4* *ls_a_bW*
                                                        *ls-filename-completion*

When you press <F9> at a location where Latex-Suite guesses a filename needs to
be typed, then a new explorer window will open up with the list of files. You
can use this window to change directories etc. Pressing <enter> on a filename in
the explorer window will automatically close the explorer window, return to the
location where you pressed <F9> from and insert the filename into that position.

Latex-Suite also tries to guess what kinds of files you might not want to insert
and hides those accordingly. For example, if you press <F9> when you are located
at \includegraphics{, then Latex-Suite knows that you will not want to insert
.tex files. Therefore, the explorer window will automatically hide these files.

As of now, Latex-Suite recognizes the following commands for filename
completion. Along with the commands, this table also lists the files which
Latex-Suite will not show for completing each command.

command                    hide pattern~
\bibliography              '^\.,\.[^b]..$'
\include \includeonly      '^\.,\.[^t]..$'
\includegraphics \psfig    '^\.,\.tex$,\.bib$,\.bbl$,\.zip$,\.gz$'
\input                     ''

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Custom command completion                                     *ls_5_5* *ls_a_bX*
                                                          *ls-completion-custom*

Latex-Suite also recognizes certain commonly used LaTeX commands for the <F9>
key. At the moment, the \bibliographystyle, \addtocontents and the
\addcontentsline commands are recognized, although more will be added in the
future. When you press the <F9> after such a command, Latex-Suite will prompt
you with a list of arguments which make sense for the command.

This functionality is available for commands for which a global variable of the
form g:Tex_completion_{<command>} is defined where <command> is the command
name. This variable is a comma separated list of values which this command
takes. For example, the argument to the \bibliographystyle command is commonly
one of abbr,alpha,plain,unsrt. Therefore, Latex-Suite defines  >
    let g:Tex_completion_bibliographystyle = 'abbr,alpha,plain,unsrt'
You can define your own completion variables in a similar manner for commands
which you might use.

|ls_6_1| Setting Compilation rules
|ls_6_2| Handling dependencies in compilation
|ls_6_3| Compiling multiple times
|ls_6_4| Customizing the compiler output
|ls_6_5| Compiling parts of a file


This functionality, available via the TeX-Suite menu, provides various tools to
compile and debug LaTeX files from within Vim.

If you are using commonly used LaTeX tools, then you should be all set as soon
as you download and install Latex-Suite. In order to compile a LaTeX file,
simply press \ll while editing the file. This runs latex on the current file and
displays the errors in a |quickfix-window| below the file being edited. You can
then scroll through the errors and press <enter> to be taken to the location of
the corresponding error. Along with the errors being listed in the quickfix
window, the corresponding log file is also opened in |preview| mode beneath the
quickfix window. It is scrolled automatically to keep in sync with the error
being viewed in the quickfix window. You will be automatically taken to the
location of the first error/warning unless you set the g:Tex_GotoError
[|ls_a_dD|] variable to 0.

Latex-Suite also supports compiling LaTeX into formats other than DVI. By
default, Latex-Suite supports PDF and PS formats. In order to choose a format
other than DVI, use the TTarget command or the TeX-Suite > Target Format menu
item. This will ask you to type in the name of the target format you want to
compile to. If a rule has been defined for the format (as described in the next
section [|ls_a_bZ|]), then Latex-Suite will switch to that format.

Trying to choose a format for which no rule has been defined will result in
Latex-Suite displaying a warning message without taking any action.

If you are using a multiple file project and need to compile a master file while
editing other files, then Latex-Suite provides a way to specify the file to be
compiled as described in latex-master-file [|ls_a_ct|].


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Setting Compilation rules                                     *ls_6_1* *ls_a_bZ*
                                                                *compiler-rules*

In order to compile LaTeX files into various formats, Latex-Suite needs to know
which external programs to call and in which way they need to be called. This
information is provided to Latex-Suite via a number of "rules". For each format
you want to compile to, you need to specify a rule. A rule is specified by
defining a variable of the form:  >
    g:Tex_CompileRule_<format>
where <format> is a string like "pdf", "dvi" etc.

Example: By default, Latex-Suite uses the following rule for compiling LaTeX
documents into DVI.  >
    g:Tex_CompileRule_dvi = 'latex --interaction=nonstopmode $*'


Default values are also provided for ps and pdf formats. You might want to
change these rules in texrc according to your local tex environment.

NOTE: For win32 users user MikTeX, sometimes the latex compiler's output has a
      bug where a single number is split across different lines. In this case,
      put the included vim-latex file distributed with Latex-Suite.
      
      

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Handling dependencies in compilation                          *ls_6_2* *ls_a_ca*
                                                           *compiler-dependency*

Latex-Suite also handles compiling dependencies automatically via certain rules
which specify the "dependency chain" for each target format. For example, if in
your case, you use  >
    .tex -> .dvi -> .ps -> .pdf
to generate pdf files from dvi files, then you will need to specify the
following setting in your Latex-Suite configuration (see customizing Latex-Suite
[|ls_a_cP|] for where these settings should go):  >
    
    let g:Tex_FormatDependency_pdf = 'dvi,ps,pdf'
    
This is a comma separated string of formats specifying the order in which the
formats to be compiled into should be chosen. With this setting, if you set the
target format to pdf, then the next time you compile via the \ll shortcut,
Latex-Suite will first generate a dvi file, then use that to generate the ps
file and finally create the pdf file from that.

NOTE: If any of the intermediate formats is listed in the
      g:Tex_MultipleCompileFormats setting as described in the section Compiling
      multiple times [|ls_a_cb|], then Latex-Suite might make multiple calls to
      the compiler to generate the output file of that format.
      
      
Along with the g:Tex_FormatDependency_{format} setting, you should ofcourse
specify the rule for compiling to each of the formats as described in the
previous section [|ls_a_bZ|]. For example, with the setting above, you could
use:  >
    
    let g:Tex_CompileRule_dvi = 'latex --interaction=nonstopmode $*'
    let g:Tex_CompileRule_ps = 'dvips -Ppdf -o $*.ps $*.dvi'
    let g:Tex_CompileRule_pdf = 'ps2pdf $*.ps'


NOTE: By default, Latex-Suite does not specify any compiler dependencies. Each
      target format for which a rule has been derived will be compiled
      independently.
      
      

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compiling multiple times                                      *ls_6_3* *ls_a_cb*
                                                            *compiling-multiple*

Most LaTeX compilers need to be re-run several times in several commonly
occurring situations in order to get a final camera ready copy. For example,
when \label's change, when new \cite commands are added etc. If the target
format you are compiling to requires multiple compilations, then you will need
to include the format in the g:Tex_MultipleCompileFormats setting. This is a
comma separated string of formats which need multiple compilations to be
generated correctly.

By default, this setting contains just the dvi format. If you use the pdflatex
compiler to generate pdf files, then you might want to also include pdf into the
above setting.

For every format included in the g:Tex_MultipleCompileFormats setting described
above, Latex-Suite will use the following logic to generate the file. Note that
although the following description uses latex to refer to the compiler, it could
be some other compiler such as pdflatex for generating pdf output.

1. If there was a .idx file, then remember its contents.

2. Run latex.

3. If the .idx file changed due to the latex compiler, then run makeindex to
   redo the .ind file and then remember to rerun latex.

4. If the .aux file generated by the latex compiler contains a \bibdata line,
   then it means that we are using a .bib file. Therefore, run bibtex.
   
   NOTE: This means that we will always run bibtex whenever we use the
         \bibliography command whether or not we actually need to. At this time,
         Latex-Suite does not parse the .aux file before and after the latex
         compiler to see if we are required to rerun bibtex.

5. If the .bbl file changes because of this, then remember to rerun latex again.

6. Also, we check to see if the LaTeX compiler gives certain standard warnings
   which notify that we need to compile once again. In this case also, remember
   to rerun LaTeX.

7. If we found we had to rerun latex, then we repeat the steps above but not
   running makeindex or bibtex again.

The LaTeX file is compiled atmost 5 times using this logic. These steps will
ensure that on most platforms/environments, you will get a clean output with all
the cross-references, citations etc correctly labelled and ordered.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Customizing the compiler output                               *ls_6_4* *ls_a_cc*
                                                 *compiler-output-customization*

Most LaTeX compilers produce a very large amount of output during compilation,
most of which is not relevant to debugging type-setting errors. The compiler
plugin provided with Latex-Suite (which is an enhanced version of the standard
compiler plugin maintained by Artem Chuprina), provides a way to filter the
compiler output so that the actual errors/warnings can be presented much more
concisely.

The compiler plugin is set up by default to function in a "non-verbose",
"ignore-common-warnings" mode, which means that irrelevant lines from the
compiler output will be ignored and some very common warnings are also ignored.
Latex-Suite does this via the global variable g:Tex_IgnoredWarnings [|ls_a_dA|].
This is a list of patterns, which can be used to filter out (or ignore) some or
the warnings and errors reported by the compiler. See the link above for its
default value.

Latex-Suite uses the g:Tex_IgnoreLevel [|ls_a_dB|] setting to set a default
ignore level. For example, for the default value of 4, Latex-Suite ignores
warnings and errors matching the first 4 patterns in g:Tex_IgnoredWarnings.

In addition to setting a default value of the ignore level, Latex-Suite provides
the ability to set the level dynamically, using the TCLevel command. For
example, if you issue the command:  >
    TCLevel 3
from within Vim, then the next time you compile the document, Latex-Suite will
ignore warnings and errors which match the first three patterns in
g:Tex_IgnoredWarnings.

When TCLevel is called with the unquoted string strict as follows:  >
    TClevel strict
then Latex-Suite switches to a "verbose", "no-lines-ignored" mode which is
useful when you want to make final checks of your document and want to be
careful not to let things slip by.

See the explanation of the settings g:Tex_IgnoredWarnings [|ls_a_dA|] and
g:Tex_IgnoreLevel [|ls_a_dB|] to find out how to customize the filtering done by
Latex-Suite

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compiling parts of a file                                     *ls_6_5* *ls_a_cd*
                                                                *part-compiling*

Latex-Suite also provides a way to compile a fragment of a document. This can be
very useful while debugging a complex equation or one chapter in a book, etc.

To do this, visually select a portion of the text and press \ll while in visual
mode. The visually selected portion will be saved to a temporary file with the
preamble from the current document prepended. Latex-Suite will then switch focus
to this temporary file and compile it. Continue to debug this file as required
and then replace the portion of the original file with this one.

Pressing \lv while viewing the temporary file will view the output file
generated from the temporary file, not the original file

Two commands |TPartComp| and |TPartView| are provided to be able to get this
functionality via the command line.

From release 1.6 onwards of Latex-Suite, the temporary file created for part
compilation will reside in the same directory as the file from which the
fragment is being created. This ensures that any relative path-names defined in
the fragment will still work. Latex-Suite will attempt to clean the temporary
file(s) created when Vim exits.

In order to view the output files created by compiling the source files, you
need to specify which external program Latex-Suite should call. You can specify
the external program using one of two settings Tex_ViewRule_format [|ls_a_dF|]
or Tex_ViewRuleComplete_format [|ls_a_dG|]. By default, Latex-Suite has default
settings for viewing various common output formats via the Tex_ViewRule_format
settings, so that if you are using commonly used programs, you should be all set
to view compiled files from within Vim by simply pressing \lv.

NOTE: The viewing function also takes the *.latexmain [|ls_a_ct|] file into
      account to decide which file to show.
      
      
If pressing \lv does not work, then it most probably has to do with incorrect
settings of the g:Tex_ViewRule_<format> [|ls_a_dF|] where <format> is the format
you are attempting to view. See the link above for how to set this according to
your system.

NOTE: On Windows and OS/X, you can leave the view rule empty to open the
      document with the default viewer on your system. On Linux/UNIX systems,
      you can use the xdg-open command to open the document with the default
      viewer.
      
      
In addition to viewing the files, Latex-Suite also supports forward and inverse
searching for certain common tools for viewing documents. See the next few
sections for details on forward and inverse searching, including an overview of
viewers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Forward Searching documents                                   *ls_7_2* *ls_a_cg*

Forward searching refers to making a viewer display a given document at a given
location from within Vim. At present, these viewers are known to support forward

NOTE: Enabling Forward and Inverse Searching
      --------------------------------------
      Most DVI viewers need "source-special" information in order to do forward
      (and inverse) searching. This information is embedded in the dvi file if
      the LaTeX source is compiled with the --src-specials option. By default,
      Latex-Suite does not supply this argument to the compiler. See the section
      on to find out how this option can be set.
      
      For pdf viewers you need to use the pdfsync |ls_u_14| package in your
      LaTeX document.

Inverse searching refers to the viewer telling Vim to display the LaTeX source
file at a given location when you double-click in the viewer window.

You will need to enable searching [|ls_a_ed|] in order to use this
functionality.

You will also need to specify certain settings to the DVI viewer conveying the
syntax which it needs to use to tell Vim how to display the source file. In YAP,
you can set this option in View > Options > Inverse Search. The Command Line
field needs to be set as follows:  >
    "C:\Program Files\vim\vim61\gvim" -c ":RemoteOpen +%l %f"
The command :RemoteOpen is supplied when you install Latex-Suite.

On *nix machines, Latex-Suite attempts to call the DVI viewer in such a way that
it already knows how to communicate with Vim. If this does not seem to be
working, you can use the RemoteOpen command described above.

|ls_8_2| Customizing what to fold
|ls_8_3| Editing the folding.vim file directly


Latex-Suite ships with the plugin SyntaxFolds.vim which is a plugin for creating
"fake" syntax folds on the fly. The fold method is actually manual but the
folding is based on LaTeX syntax. This offers a speed increase over regular
syntax folding. Ofcourse it has the disadvantage that the folds are not dynamic,
i.e newly created syntax items are not automatically folded up. (This is a
compromise between speed and convenience).

When you open up a LaTeX file, all the portions will be automatically folded up.
However, no new folds will be created until you press <F6> or \rf. (rf stands
for "refresh folds").

The fold-text is set to the first line of the folded text unless the fold is a
table, figure etc. (an environment). In this case, if a \caption and/or a label
is found in the folded region, then those are used to make a more meaningful
fold-text, otherwise the second line of the environment is displayed along with
the name of the environment. In other words, the following  >
    \begin{figure}[h]
        \centerline{\psfig{figure=slidercrank.eps,height=6cm}}
        \caption{The Slider Crank Mechanism.}
        \label{fig:slidercrank}
    \end{figure}
    % a LaTeX comment.
    \begin{eqnarray}
        \sin(\pi) = 0
    \end{eqnarray}


will be shown as:  >

By default Latex-Suite creates folds in the following manner:

  >
    \chapter
    \section
    %%fakesection
        \subsection
            \subsubsection
                \item

                    \eqnarray
                    \figure
                    \table
                    \footnote
The indentation shows the "nestedness" of the folding scheme. See the next
section [|ls_a_ck|] to see how you can change this scheme.

From version 1.6 onwards, the folding in Latex-Suite can be controlled to a
large extent via a number of global variables.



Tex_FoldedSections                                          *ls_8_2_1* *ls_a_cl*
                                                            *Tex_FoldedSections*

This entry defines which sections will be folded. This setting is a comma
separated list of section names. The default value is:  >
    part,chapter,section,%%fakesection,
    subsection,subsubsection,paragraph
Each of the entries in the list will fold up a section of the corresponding
name. The %%fakesection section is provided as a means for the user to group
lines into "fake" sections. A %%fakesection is assumed to start on a line which
begins with the string %%fakesection and continue till the start of the next
\section, \subsection or any other section.

Tex_FoldedEnvironments                                      *ls_8_2_2* *ls_a_cm*
                                                        *Tex_FoldedEnvironments*

This entry defines which environments will be folded. It is a comma separated
string of words each of which defines a single environment. The default setting
is  >
    verbatim,comment,eq,gather,
    align,figure,table,thebibliography,
    keywords,abstract,titlepage
The words need not be standard Latex environments. You can add any word you
like. Also, each word will fold up all environments whose name begins with that
word. For example, in the setting above, the word "eq" folds up the
\begin{equation}, \begin{eqnarray}, \begin{eqnarray*} environments. To avoid
this, you can replace the word "eq" with "eq}".

See also advanced fold settings [|ls_a_cp|].


Tex_FoldedCommands                                          *ls_8_2_3* *ls_a_cn*
                                                            *Tex_FoldedCommands*

This entry defines which commands will be folded. It is a comma separated string
of words each of which defines a single command. The default setting is empty,
i.e no commands are folded. The words need not be standard Latex commands. You
can use whatever words you like. Each word will fold all commands whose name
begins with that word as in the case of the Tex_FoldedEnvironments [|ls_a_cm|]
variable.

NOTE: It is very difficult to fold commands reliably because it is very
      difficult to create a regexp which will match a line containing unmatched
      parentheses (or curly brackets), but will not match a line containing
      matched parentheses.
      
      Just to make things safer, only lines which start a command but do not
      contain additional curly braces after the command has started are folded.
      In other words, if you wanted to fold the the command "mycommand", then
      the lines  >
          \mycommand{This is a line
          and some more text on the next line
          }
<     will be folded, but the lines  >
          \mycommand{This is a \textbf{line}
          and some more text
          }
<     will not be folded. This is a bug which is very difficult to fix.

This entry defines fold syntax for certain items which do not naturally fit into
the section, environment of command lists. It is a comma separated list of
words. The default value is:  >
    item,preamble,<<<
NOTE: Unlike the other Tex_FoldedXXXX variables, the words in this setting are
      limited to take values from the following list:
      
      Value       Meaning~
      comments    Folds up contiguous blocks of comments
      item        Folds up the \items within list environments
      preamble    Folds up the preamble of a document. (The part between the
                  \documentclass command and the \begin{document} environment)
      <<<         Folds defined manually by the user using the <<< and >>> strings
                  as fold-markers.
      
      Any other words in the Tex_FoldedMisc setting are silently ignored.

Advanced Fold setting details                               *ls_8_2_5* *ls_a_cp*
                                                         *fold-setting-advanced*

The order of the words in the Tex_FoldedXXXX variables is _important_. The order
defines the order in which the folds are nested. For example, the value
"subsection,section" for the Tex_FoldedSections variable will not fold any
subsections at all. This is because the folds are created in the _reverse_ order
in which they occur in the Tex_FoldedSections setting and also, once a fold is
created, the interior of the fold is not examined for creating additional folds.
In the above case, this means that a \section is folded first and then its
interior is not examined further. The correct value should have been
"section,subsection"

                                                 *fold-setting-adding* *ls_a_ee*
Each of the fold setting variables Tex_FoldedSections, Tex_FoldedEnvironments
etc., as explained previously is a comma separated string of variables. However,
to make it easier to _add_ to the default settings without having to repeat the
whole default setting again, Latex-Suite uses the following logic in forming the
complete setting string from the Tex_FoldedXXXX variables. If the variable
starts with a comma, then Tex_FoldedXXXX is added to the end of the default
string rather than replacing it. Similarly, if it ends with a comma, then it
will be prepended to the beginning of the default setting rather than replacing
it.

For example, if Tex_FoldedEnvironments is set to the string "myenv", then only
an environment of the form \begin{myenv} will be folded. However, if the
Tex_FoldedEnvironments setting is ",myenv", then the \begin{myenv} environment
will be folded after all other environments in the default setting have been
folded. On the other hand if Tex_FoldedEnvironments is of the form "myenv,", the
\begin{myenv} environment will be folded before the rest of the environments in
the default setting.

Editing the folding.vim file directly                         *ls_8_3* *ls_a_cq*
                                                               *editing-folding*

If you are using version 1.5 of Latex-Suite or older, you will need to directly
edit the $VIM/ftplugin/latex-suite/folding.vim file if you wish to modify the
folding scheme. You will need to modify the function MakeTexFolds() defined in
that file to modify the fold syntax. MakeTexFolds makes a number of calls to
AddSyntaxFoldItem. Each such call defines a new "fold item". The order in which
these calls are made defines how the folds are nested. For example, if you
desire an figure environment to be nested within a section, then you should
define the fold for the figure first. The syntax of AddSyntaxFoldItem is as
follows:  >
    AddSyntaxFoldItem(startpat, endpat, startoff, endoff [, startskip, endskip])
If the last two arguments are omitted, then they are assumed to default to the
empty strings ''. The explanation for each argument is as follows:

Argument     Explanation~
startpat     a line matching this pattern defines the beginning of a fold.
endpat       a line matching this pattern defines the end of a fold.
startoff     this is the offset from the starting line at which folding will
             actually start
endoff       like startoff, but gives the offset of the actual fold end from the
             line satisfying endpat. startoff and endoff are necessary when the
             folding region does not have a specific end pattern corresponding to
             a start pattern. for example in LaTeX, \section{Section Name} defines
             the beginning of a section, but there is no command which
             specifically ends a section. Thus a \section is assumed to end 1 line
             _before_ another section starts.
startskip    A Pattern Which Defines The Beginning Of A "Skipped" Region.
             
             For example, suppose we define a \itemize fold as follows:  >
                  =  '^\s*\\item',
                  = '^\s*\\item\|^\s*\\end{\(enumerate\|itemize\|description\)}',
                  = 0,
                  = -1
<            
             
             This defines a fold which starts with a line beginning with an \item
             and ending one line before a line beginning with an \item or
             \end{enumerate} etc.
             
             Then, as long as \item's are not nested things are fine. However,
             once items begin to nest, the fold started by one \item can end
             because of an \item in an \itemize environment within this \item.
             i.e, the following can happen:  >
                 \begin{itemize}
                 \item Some text                         <------- fold will start here
                 This item will contain a nested item
                 \begin{itemize}                         <----- fold will end here because next line contains \item...
                 \item Hello  
                 \end{itemize}                           <----- ... instead of here.
                 \item Next item of the parent itemize  
                 \end{itemize}
<            
             
             Therefore, in order to completely define a folding item which allows
             nesting, we need to also define a "skip" pattern. startskip and end
             skip do that. Leave '' when there is no nesting.
endskip      the pattern which defines the end of the "skip" pattern for nested
             folds.

NOTE: Example 1
      ---------
      A syntax fold region for the latex section is defined with the following
      arguments to AddSyntaxFoldItem:  >
          startpat = "\\section{"
          endpat   = "\\section{"
          startoff = 0
          endoff   = -1
          startskip = ''
          endskip = ''
<     Note that the start and end patterns are thus the same and endoff has a
      negative value to capture the effect of a section ending one line before
      the next starts.
      
      
NOTE: Example 2
      ---------
      A syntax fold region for the \itemize environment is:  >
          startpat = '^\s*\\item',
          endpat = '^\s*\\item\|^\s*\\end{\(enumerate\|itemize\|description\)}',
          startoff = 0,
          endoff = -1,
          startskip = '^\s*\\begin{\(enumerate\|itemize\|description\)}',
          endskip = '^\s*\\end{\(enumerate\|itemize\|description\)}'
<     Note the use of startskip and endskip to allow nesting.

                                               *latex-project-example* *ls_a_ef*
Many LaTeX projects contain multiple source files which are \included from a
master file. A typical example of this situation is a directory layout such as
the following

  >
    thesis/
        main.tex
        abstract.tex
        intro/
            intro.tex
            figures/
                fig1.eps
                fig2.eps
        chapter1/
            chap1.tex
            figures/
                fig1.eps
        conclusion/
            conclusion.tex
            figures/


In the above case, main.tex will typically look like

  >
    % file: main.tex
    \documentclass{report}
    \begin{document}
    
    \input{abstract.tex}
    \input{intro/intro.tex}
    \input{chapter1/chap1.tex}
    \input{conclusion/conclusion.tex}
    
    \end{document}


                                     *latex-master-file-specification* *ls_a_eg*
In such situations, you will need to convey to Latex-Suite that main.tex is the
main file which \inputs the other files. This is done by creating an empty file
called main.tex.latexmain in the same directory in which main.tex resides. This
file is called the _master file_ in this manual. See Tex_MainFileExpression
[|ls_a_eh|] for an alternative way of specifying the master file.

NOTE: Here main.tex.latexmain is (obviously) a different file from main.tex
      itself. main.tex need not be renamed. This ofcourse restricts each
      directory to have a single master file.
      
      
Each time Latex-Suite opens a new LaTeX file, it will try to see if it is part
of a multiple file project by searching upwards (to the root of the file-system)
from the current file's directory to see if it finds a file of the form
*.latexmain. If such a file is found, then it is considered that the current
file is part of a larger project. The name of the LaTeX master file is inferred
directly from the first part of the *.latexmain file as described in the example
above.

                                                        *latex-project-settings*

If a master file [|ls_a_ct|] is found, then Latex-Suite :sources the file. Thus
this file needs to contain valid Vim commands. This file is typically used to
store project specific settings.

Some typical per-project settings which are best put in the master file are
Tex_ProjectSourceFiles [|ls_a_dt|]

In the example described previously [|ls_a_ef|], if you are editing
intro/intro.tex and press \ll, then you still want Latex-Suite to compile
main.tex, because intro/intro.tex is merely a fragment which is \input'ed into
main.tex. If the master file is already specified using the *.latexmain
convention described previously [|ls_a_ef|], then Latex-Suite will automatically
compile the master file when you are editing any of its \input'ed fragments.
Thus pressing \ll while editing intro/intro.tex will compile main.tex.

                                              *Tex_MainFileExpression* *ls_a_eh*
If you wish to use some different logic to specify the main file name, you can
specify a custom expression via the Tex_MainFileExpression variable. This is a
string containing a valid vim expression. In addition, you can use a variable
modifier which is in the format used for |filename-modifiers|, for example,
':p:h'. You should utilize this variable to modify the filename of the main
file.  >
    let g:Tex_MainFileExpression = 'MainFile(modifier)'
    function! MainFile(fmod)
        if glob('*.latexmain') != ''
            return fnamemodify(glob('*.latexmain'), a:fmod)
        else
            return ''
        endif

                                          *remapping-latex-suite-keys* *ls_a_ei*
Most of the mappings used in Latex-Suite can be mapped to a different key
combination to suit your particular needs. An example best explains the
procedure for doing this. Suppose you want to remap the <C-j> key which
Latex-Suite (actually imaps.vim) uses to jump to the next placeholder. To do
this, you first need to find out which <Plug> mapping <C-j> is derived from. You
will need to look at the relevant section of this manual to do this. For
example, the section IMAP mappings [|ls_a_cw|] has the information that the
<C-j> key is derived from <Plug>IMAP_JumpForward. Therefore to remap the <C-j>
key to say <C-space>, you will need to put a statement like the following in
your ~/.vimrc.  >
    imap <C-space> <Plug>IMAP_JumpForward


NOTE: To change the IMAP mappings which affect jumping between placeholders, the
      map statement above has to be placed in your ~/.vimrc. For other mappings
      you can place the map statement in your $VIM/ftplugin/tex.vim file. The
      reason for this is that the <C-j> maps are created in plugin/imaps.vim,
      which is sourced as soon as Vim starts before sourcing any ftplugin files.
      
      


IMAP mappings                                              *ls_10_1_1* *ls_a_cw*
                                                           *customize-imap-maps*

These mappings are utilized for jumping between placeholders as described here
[|ls_a_eD|]. See the parent section [|ls_a_cv|] to find out how to use this
information to change the default maps.

                                               *Plug_IMAP_JumpForward* *ls_a_ej*

<Plug>IMAP_DeleteAndJumpForward    (none)
<Plug>IMAP_DeleteAndJumpBack       (none)

<Plug>IMAP_JumpForward takes you to the location of the next place-holder
[|ls_a_eD|].

<Plug>IMAP_JumpBack takes you to the previous place-holder [|ls_a_eD|].

<Plug>IMAP_DeleteAndJumpForward deletes the presently selected place-holder and
jumps to the next place-holder irrespective of whether the present placeholder
is empty or not and ignoring the value of place-holder settings like
g:Imap_DeleteEmptyPlaceHolders [|ls_a_cW|] and g:Imap_StickyPlaceHolders
[|ls_a_cX|]

<Plug>IMAP_DeleteAndJumpBack deletes the presently selected place-holder and
jumps to the previous place-holder irrespective of whether the present
placeholder is empty or not and ignoring the value of place-holder settings like
g:Imap_DeleteEmptyPlaceHolders [|ls_a_cW|] and g:Imap_StickyPlaceHolders
[|ls_a_cX|]

These mappings are are described in the section Alt key macros [|ls_a_bA|]. See
the parent section [|ls_a_ei|] to see how to use the following information to
remap keys.

Latex Suite Commands                                         *ls_10_2* *ls_a_cy*
                                                          *latex-suite-commands*



:TMacro [{macro}]                                 *ls_10_2_1* *ls_a_cz* *TMacro*

When used without any arguments lists all available macros defined in runtime
ftplugin/latex-suite/macros/ directories and prompts you to choose one of them.
With one argument |:read| this macro under cursor position. With more than one
argument it will not work :) In Vim >= 6.2 works completion of names of macros
(see 'wildmenu', 'wildmode' for more about command-line completion).


:TMacroEdit [{macro}]                                      *ls_10_2_2* *ls_a_cA*
                                                                    *TMacroEdit*

Splits window for editing {macro}. When used without any arguments lists all
available macros defined in runtime ftplugin/latex-suite/macros/ directories and
prompt you to choose one of them. When you try to edit {macro} not from local
directory Latex-Suite will copy it to your local directory with suffix "-local".
If local copy already exists Latex-Suite prompt for overwriting it. In Vim >=
6.2 works completion of names of macros (see 'wildmenu', 'wildmode' for more
about command-line completion).


:TMacroNew                                                 *ls_10_2_3* *ls_a_cB*
                                                                     *TMacroNew*

Splits window to write new macro. Directory in new buffer is locally changed to
Latex-Suite/macros/.


:TMacroDelete [{macro}]                                    *ls_10_2_4* *ls_a_cC*
                                                                  *TMacroDelete*

Delets {macro} from your local ftplugin/latex-suite/macros/ directory. When used
without any arguments lists all available macros defined in Latex-Suite/macros/
directory and prompt you to choose one of them. When you choose to delete
{macro} which is not in your local directory Latex-Suite will refuse to delete
it. In Vim >= 6.2 works completion of names of macros (see 'wildmenu',
'wildmode' for more about command-line completion)


:TPackage [{package, ...}]                                 *ls_10_2_5* *ls_a_cD*
                                                                      *TPackage*

When used without any arguments lists name of the packages for which support is
available. If you are using Vim GUI and have Tex_Menus set to 1, then it will
list all files found in the $VIM/ftplugin/latex-suite/packages directory.
Otherwise, Latex-Suite will list files found in the
$VIM/ftplugin/latex-suite/dictionaries directory. Choosing a file from the list
will insert a  >
    \usepackage[<++>]{<packname>}
line into the buffer at the current cursor location. For Vim 6.2 and above, you
can use command-line completion to choose a package file. You can also call
TPackage with one or more package names separated with spaces in which case,
Latex-Suite will insert \usepackage lines for each of them in turn.

After inserting the \usepackage line(s), Latex-Suite will support it (them) in
various ways as described in the section Actions taken for supported packages
[|ls_a_bL|].


:TPackageUpdate                                            *ls_10_2_6* *ls_a_cE*
                                                                *TPackageUpdate*

This command `reads' name of package under cursor and turns on possible support.


:TPackageUpdateAll                                         *ls_10_2_7* *ls_a_cF*
                                                             *TPackageUpdateAll*

After issuing this command latexSuite scans the file in looking for not declared
packages, removing not needed entries from Packages menu and turning off not
necessary packages' dictionaries.


:TTemplate [{template}]                                    *ls_10_2_8* *ls_a_cG*
                                                                     *TTemplate*

When used without any arguments lists all available templates from
latex-suite/templates/ directory and prompts to choose one of them. With one
argument :0|read| {template} file. With more than one argument it will not work
:) In Vim >= 6.2 works completion of names of macros (see 'wildmenu', 'wildmode'
for more about command-line completion)


:TSection [{argument}]                                     *ls_10_2_9* *ls_a_cH*
                                                                      *TSection*

Used without any arguments inserts last section type (|latex-sectioning|).
Accepts arguments: n> inserts section name in <n> logical level. Levels are:
0    part
1    chapter
2    section
3    subsection
4    subsubsection
5    paragraph
6    subparagraph


+<n>    inserts section name <n> logical levels above the last used comand
-<n>    inserts section name <n> logical levels below the last used comand
+       inserts section name one logical level below the last used command (equal
        to +1).
++      inserts section name two logical levels below the last used command (equal
        to +2).
-       inserts section name one logical level over the last used command (equal
        to -1).
--      inserts section name two logical levels over the last used command (equal
        to -2).



Command accepts also latexSuite mappings (|latex-macros|) without preceding S
and in lowercase:  >
    :TSection pa
will result in \part{}. It is possible to use full names of sections: :TSection
part


:TSectionAdvanced                                         *ls_10_2_10* *ls_a_cI*
                                                              *TSectionAdvanced*

Accepts the same arguments as |TSection| but leads to a couple of questions
(whether you want to include the section in the table of contents, whether there
is a shorter name for the table of contents) and then creates a more intelligent
template.


:TLook                                            *ls_10_2_11* *ls_a_cJ* *TLook*

Accepts one argument. Will look through .tex files in directory of edited file
for argument. It can be regexp. You don't have to enclose argument in "". <cr>
takes you to location. Other keys work as described in |latex-viewer|. Note:
TLook uses :grep command and is using 'grepprg'. Its regular expressions can be
different from those of Vim.


:TLookBib                                                 *ls_10_2_12* *ls_a_cK*
                                                                      *TLookBib*

Accepts one argument. Will look through .bib files in directory of edited file
for argument. It can be regexp. You don't have to enclose argument in "". <cr>
takes you to location. Other keys work as described in |latex-viewer|.

NOTE: TLookBib uses :grep command and is using 'grepprg'. Its regular
      expressions can be different from those of Vim.
      
      


:TLookAll                                                 *ls_10_2_13* *ls_a_cL*
                                                                      *TLookAll*

Accepts one argument. Will look through all files in directory of edited file
for argument. It can be regexp. You don't have to enclose argument in "". <cr>
takes you to location. Other keys work as described in |latex-viewer|. Note:
TLook uses :grep command and is using 'grepprg'. Its regular expressions can be
different from those of Vim.


:TPartComp                                                *ls_10_2_14* *ls_a_cM*
                                                                     *TPartComp*

No argument allowed but accepts range in all formats. Define fragment of
interest with :'a,'b, :/a/,/b/, :'<,'> or :20,30. All other rules of compilation
apply.

Customizing Latex-Suite is done by defining certain global variables in
$VIM/ftplugin/tex.vim, where $VIM corresponds to ~/.vim for *nix machines and
~/vimfiles for windows machines. This file is not part of the Latex-Suite
distribution. You will need to create this file yourself (or modify it if it
exists) if you need to change any default settings. Since this file is not
included as part of the Latex-Suite distribution, it will not be over-written in
subsequent updates.

The default settings in Latex-Suite are defined in
$VIM/ftplugin/latex-suite/texrc. Please take a look at this file if you find
this documentation incomplete or confusing. That file is also well documented.

This chapter describes the various settings which effect Latex-Suite and their
default values. The settings are broken up into sections according to the
behavior which they influence.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
General Settings                                             *ls_11_1* *ls_a_cQ*
                                                   *ls-general-purpose-settings*



Tex_Debug                                                  *ls_11_1_1* *ls_a_cR*
                                                                     *Tex_Debug*

Type             boolean
Default Value    0

If set to 1, then Latex-Suite will create certain global debug statements which
can be printed by doing  >
    :call Tex_PrintDebug()



Tex_UsePython                                              *ls_11_1_2* *ls_a_cS*
                                                                 *Tex_UsePython*

Type             boolean
Default Value    1

If Latex-Suite detects that your vim is python enabled (using has('python')),
then it tries to use python in certain places to speed things up. If this
misbehaves, you can set this to zero, in which case, Latex-Suite will use
vimscript to accomplish the same.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Place-Holder Customization                                   *ls_11_2* *ls_a_cT*
                                                     *customizing-place-holders*

Latex-Suite uses place-holders [|ls_a_eD|] to minimize using the movement keys
while typing. The following settings affect how place-holders are used.

NOTE: These setting need to be set in your ~/.vimrc, not $VIM/ftplugin/tex.vim
      because these settings affect the behavior of imaps.vim, which is a global
      plugin, not a file-type plugin.
      
      


g:Imap_UsePlaceHolders                                     *ls_11_2_1* *ls_a_cU*
                                                          *Imap_UsePlaceHolders*


Type             Boolean
Default Value    1

Setting this to zero completely disables using place-holders.


g:Imap_PlaceHolderStart & g:Imap_PlaceHolderEnd            *ls_11_2_2* *ls_a_cV*
                                                         *Imap_PlaceHolderStart*

                                                 *Imap_PlaceHolderEnd* *ls_a_er*
Setting                  Type      Value~
Imap_PlaceHolderStart    String    '<+'
Imap_PlaceHolderEnd      String    '+>'

These settings affect the strings displayed at the beginning and end of the
place-holder string. Set these strings to a value different than a commonly
occurring sequence of characters.

NOTE: TIP
      ---
      If you use the latin1 encoding and do not type in french, then you can set
      these strings to the \xab and \xbb characters (the french quotation
      marks).
      
      


g:Imap_DeleteEmptyPlaceHolders                             *ls_11_2_3* *ls_a_cW*
                                                  *Imap_DeleteEmptyPlaceHolders*


Type             Boolean
Default Value    1

When set to one, non-descriptive or empty place-holders are deleted on pressing
<Ctrl-J>.


g:Imap_StickyPlaceHolders                                  *ls_11_2_4* *ls_a_cX*
                                                       *Imap_StickyPlaceHolders*


Type             Boolean
Default Value    1

When set to 1, in visual mode, <Ctrl-J> takes you to the next placeholder
without deleting the current placeholder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Macro Customization                                          *ls_11_3* *ls_a_cY*
                                                            *customizing-macros*



Tex_Env_name                                               *ls_11_3_1* *ls_a_cZ*
                                                                  *Tex_Env_name*

If you wish to wish to expand certain environments differently from the way
Latex-Suite does it, you can define custom expansions using global variables of
the form Tex_Env_{name} where name corresponds to the environment.

For example, if you press <F5> after typing theorem, Latex-Suite will by default
expand it to  >
    \begin{theorem}
         \label{<++>}<++>
    \end{theorem}<++>
However, if you wish change this to  >
    \begin{theorem}
         <++>
    \end{theorem}<++>
then define the following variable  >
    let g:Tex_Env_theorem = "\\begin{theorem}\<CR><++>\<CR>\\end{theorem}"
<   

If the expansion uses special keys such as carriage return etc, then use
double-quotes and use the "\<key>" notation for special keys. Backslashes have
to be doubled.

You could even use strings returned by functions as the expansion by using the
IMAP_PutTextWithMovement() [|ls_a_ea|] function.

If the name of the environment contains special characters (for example, the
eqnarray* environment), then use the following form:  >
    let g:Tex_Env_{'eqnarray*'} = 
            \ "\\begin{eqnarray*}\<CR><++> &=& <++>\<CR>\\end{eqnarray*}<++>"
This will make pressing <F5> after eqnarray* expand to  >
    \begin{eqnarray*}

Tex_Com_name                                               *ls_11_3_2* *ls_a_da*
                                                                  *Tex_Com_name*

If you wish to define new expansions for fast command insertion as described
here [|ls_a_bo|], or redefine expansions from the default values in Latex-Suite,
you will need to define variables of the form g:Tex_Com_{name} where name is a
command name. For example, with the setting  >
    let g:Tex_Com_frac = "\\frac{<++>}{<++>}<++>"
pressing <F7> after typing frac will change it to \frac{<++>}{<++>}<++>

See Tex_Env_name [|ls_a_cZ|] for additional details on how to create this
setting in various special circumstances.


Enabling / disabling macros                                *ls_11_3_3* *ls_a_db*
                                                                *macro-enabling*

The following variables disable various parts of the macro functionality of
Latex-Suite. See the links to the relevant sections to see what functionality
setting each of the variables to zero will take away.

                                                 *Tex_EnvironmentMaps* *ls_a_es*

Type             Boolean
Default Value    0

If this variable is set to 1, then when an environment is chosen from the menu
then for selected environments, Latex-Suite asks a series of questions on the
command line and inserts a template with the corresponding fields already filled
in. Setting this to zero will insert a template with place-holders [|ls_a_eD|]
marking off the places where fields need to be filled.


g:Imap_FreezeImap                                          *ls_11_3_5* *ls_a_dd*
                                                               *Imap_FreezeImap*

Type             boolean
Default Value    0

This option when set to 1, temporarily freezes Latex-Suite's macro expansion. It
might be useful when you are using some other keymap which is causing excessive
macro expansion. Use a buffer-local variable of the same name if you wish to
affect just the present buffer.


g:Tex_CatchVisMapErrors                                    *ls_11_3_6* *ls_a_de*
                                                         *Tex_CatchVisMapErrors*


Type             Boolean
Default Value    1

With so many visual maps, its helpful to have a way of catching typing errors
made in visual mode. What this does is to prompt you to correct your visual mode
mapping if you start out with and then type some illegal keys. It basically maps
just the g:Tex_Leader character to a function.


g:Tex_Diacritics                                           *ls_11_3_7* *ls_a_df*
                                                                *Tex_Diacritics*


Type             Boolean
Default Value    0

Whether or not you want to use diacritics [|ls_a_bw|].


g:Tex_Leader                                               *ls_11_3_8* *ls_a_dg*
                                                                    *Tex_Leader*


Type             String
Default Value    '`'

The mappings in Latex-Suite are by default prefixed with the back-tick
character. For example, `/ inserts \frac{<++>}{<++>}<++> etc. You can change the
prefix with the following setting. ',', '/', '`' are preferred values. '' or '\'
will lead to a _lot_ of trouble.

g:Tex_Leader is also used for visual mode mappings for fonts.


g:Tex_Leader2                                              *ls_11_3_9* *ls_a_dh*
                                                                   *Tex_Leader2*


Type             String
Default Value    ','

In order to avoid clashes between the large number of visual mode macros
provided, the visual mode macros for environments [|ls_a_bm|] and sections start
with a character different from g:Tex_Leader.


g:Tex_PromptedEnvironments                                *ls_11_3_10* *ls_a_di*
                                                      *Tex_PromptedEnvironments*


Type             String
Default Value    'eqnarray*,eqnarray,equation,equation*,\[,$$,align,align*'

This string represents a comma separated list of fields corresponding to
environments. Pressing <F5> in insert-mode in the body of the document asks you
to choose from one of these environments to insert.

Leaving this string empty will leave the <F5> key unmapped


g:Tex_HotKeyMappings                                      *ls_11_3_11* *ls_a_dj*
                                                            *Tex_HotKeyMappings*


Type             String
Default Value    'eqnarray*,eqnarray,bmatrix'

This string represents a comma separated list of environments which are mapped
to <Shift-F-1> through <Shift-F-4>. For example, pressing <Shift-F-2> with this
setting inserts the eqnarray environment.

Leaving this string empty will leave <Shift-F-1> through <Shift-F-4> unmapped.

NOTE: Only the first four fields of this list are used. The rest are silently
      ignored.
      
      


g:Tex_PromptedCommands                                    *ls_11_3_12* *ls_a_dk*
                                                          *Tex_PromptedCommands*


Type             String
Default Value    'footnote,cite,pageref,label'

This string represents a comma separated list of LaTeX commands which
Latex-Suite uses for the <F7> and <S-F7> maps as described here [|ls_a_bo|].

Leaving this string empty will leave the <F7> key unmapped.


Tex_ItemStyle_environment                                 *ls_11_3_13* *ls_a_dl*
                                                     *Tex_ItemStyle_environment*

This setting affects the style which Latex-Suite uses to insert an \item when
<Alt-I> is pressed as described here [|ls_a_bE|]. By default Latex-Suite defines
styles for the following environments:

Environment        Style~
itemize            \item
enumerate          \item
theindex           \item
thebibliography    \item[<+biblabel+>]{<+bibkey+>} <++>
description        \item[<+label+>] <++>

Each style is defined by a variable of the form g:Tex_ItemStyle_{envname} where
envname is the name of the environment for which the style is defined. For
example, by default  >
    g:Tex_ItemStyle_description = '\item[<+label+>] <++>'
Redefining the style for a particular environment or defining a style for an
entirely new environment is simply a matter of setting the value of a variable
of the corresponding name.

Type             Boolean
Default Value    1

Whether or not <Backspace> deletes diacritics.


g:Tex_SmartKeyQuote                                        *ls_11_4_2* *ls_a_do*
                                                             *Tex_SmartKeyQuote*


Type             Boolean
Default Value    1

Whether or not the smart quotes [|ls_a_bz|] functionality is available.

If enabled, the quote characters can be customized by setting the following
variables:

Setting                  Value~
g:Tex_SmartQuoteOpen     "``"
g:Tex_SmartQuoteClose    "''"

Non-English users will want to change these settings to their locale. These
global variables will be ignored if there are buffer-local variables (with the
same name), which may be set in the language specific package files, such as
$VIM/ftplugin/latex-suite/packages/german.

Setting                      Explanation                         Default Value~
g:Tex_ViewerCwindowHeight    The height of the cwindow which     5
                             displays the list of \labels        
                             etc.                                
g:Tex_ViewerPreviewHeight    The height of the preview window    10
                             which shows the context of a        
                             \label etc.                         
g:Tex_ExplorerHeight         The height of the explorer          10
                             window which lists the files        
                             from which to choose an image       
                             file.                               
g:Tex_ImageDir               The directory to scan for images    ''

                                                                 *Tex_BIBINPUTS*


Type             string
Default Value    ''

This string describes the directories which are scanned while trying to search
for .bib and .bbl files. See the cite completion section [|ls_a_bU|] for more
details.

This string should be set in the syntax accepted by Vim's native 'path' setting.
Do not include the present directory '.'. While searching for bibliography
files, the present directory will be prepended to this variable.


Tex_UseSimpleLabelSearch                                   *ls_11_5_3* *ls_a_ds*
                                                      *Tex_UseSimpleLabelSearch*

When set to 1, Latex-Suite searches for \labels in all .tex files in the
directory containing the file being edited when <F9> is pressed. See \ref
completion [|ls_a_bT|] for details.


g:Tex_ProjectSourceFiles                                   *ls_11_5_4* *ls_a_dt*
                                                        *Tex_ProjectSourceFiles*


Type             String
Default Value    ''

This setting is meant to be initialized on a per-project basis using the
Latex-Suite master file [|ls_a_ct|] as described in Latex-Suite Project
[|ls_a_cr|] section. It is a list of source files which are used in the project.
If defined, then instead of using the logic described in
Tex_UseSimpleLabelSearch [|ls_a_ds|] to search for files in which to search for
\labels, we simply search for \labels in this list. This significantly reduces
the time it takes to generate the list of possible completions for large
projects.

The list is specified as a whitespace separated list of filenames relative to
the location of the main file.


g:Tex_RememberCiteSearch                                   *ls_11_5_5* *ls_a_du*
                                                        *Tex_RememberCiteSearch*


Type             Boolean
Default Value    0

When this variable is non-zero, then Latex-Suite will try to remember results
from the \cite completion as described in this section [|ls_a_bV|].

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compiler Customization                                       *ls_11_6* *ls_a_dv*
                                                         *customizing-compiling*

The following settings affect Latex-Suite's compilation functionality



g:Tex_DefaultTargetFormat                                  *ls_11_6_1* *ls_a_dw*
                                                       *Tex_DefaultTargetFormat*


Type             String
Default Value    dvi for windows/*nix and pdf for mac

Use this setting to choose the default target format. For example, setting this
to pdf makes Latex-Suite compile a pdf file when you press \ll and fire up the
pdf viewer on pressing \lv. Make sure that a rules for compiling and viewing
have been defined for this target format as described here [|ls_a_dx|] and here
[|ls_a_dF|].


g:Tex_CompileRule_<format>                                 *ls_11_6_2* *ls_a_dx*
                                                        *Tex_CompileRule_format*

Here <format> refers to the target format for which this rule is defined.
Latex-Suite supports compiling into dvi, ps and pdf by default. All these rules
are strings defined by default as follows:


g:Tex_CompileRule_dvi    'latex -interaction=nonstopmode $*'
g:Tex_CompileRule_ps     'ps2pdf $*'
g:Tex_CompileRule_pdf    'pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode $*'

If you desire forward and inverse searching via Latex-Suite, you will need to
change g:Tex_CompileRule_dvi to include -src-specials. However, this has been
known to cause problems with the output file. Therefore, use this with care.


g:Tex_FormatDependency_<format>                            *ls_11_6_3* *ls_a_dy*

Type             string
Default Value    ''

By default, there are no format dependencies defined. Each definition is of the
form above where <format> is a string such as 'dvi' etc.

The value of each string is a comma separated string such as 'dvi,ps'. See the
Compiler dependency [|ls_a_ca|] section to see how to use/specify this setting


g:Tex_MultipleCompileFormats                               *ls_11_6_4* *ls_a_dz*
                                                    *Tex_MultipleCompileFormats*

Type             string
Default Value    'dvi'

This is a comma separated string of formats for which the compiler needs to be
called multiple times in order to get cross-references, citations etc right. See
the Compiling multiple times [|ls_a_cb|] section for details.


g:Tex_IgnoredWarnings                                      *ls_11_6_5* *ls_a_dA*
                                                           *Tex_IgnoredWarnings*


Type             String
Default Value    a new-line separated list of patterns as described below

The default value of this setting is  >
    \"Underfull\n".
    \"Overfull\n".
    \"specifier changed to\n".
    \"You have requested\n".
    \"Missing number, treated as zero.\n".
    \"There were undefined references\n"
    \"Citation %.%# undefined"
This setting defines a set of patterns which will be filtered out when
displaying the output from the latex compiler. This is to aid in filtering out
very common warnings/errors.

NOTE: Remember to check the value of g:Tex_IgnoreLevel [|ls_a_dB|] when you
      change this setting. For example, if you append a new pattern which you
      would like to ignore by default, increase the value of g:Tex_IgnoreLevel.
      
      


g:Tex_IgnoreLevel                                          *ls_11_6_6* *ls_a_dB*
                                                               *Tex_IgnoreLevel*


Type             Integer
Default Value    7

This setting defines a "filter level" or an "ignore level". A value of 7 for
instance means that any warning/error matching with any of the first 7 fields of
g:Tex_IgnoredWarnings [|ls_a_dA|] will be ignored. Setting this value to zero
will mean that no error/warning is ignored. However, even with a value of zero,
Latex-Suite will filter out most of the text which a LaTeX compiler typically
produces. Use  >
    TCLevel strict
from within Vim in order to see all the lines from the compiler's output.


Tex_UseMakefile                                            *ls_11_6_7* *ls_a_dC*
                                                               *Tex_UseMakefile*

Type             boolean
Default Value    1

When set to 1, then if a makefile or Makefile is present in the current
directory, then Latex-Suite sets the makeprg option to just "make <target>",
where <target> is the target format chosen using the TCTarget or TTarget
commands.

When set to 0, then Latex-Suite will set the makeprg setting to whatever is
defined by the g:Tex_CompileRule_target [|ls_a_dx|] setting.


g:Tex_GotoError                                            *ls_11_6_8* *ls_a_dD*
                                                                 *Tex_GotoError*


Type             boolean
Default Value    1

If set to 1, then pressing \ll will take you to the location of the first
warning/error, otherwise you will remain in the original location but the
errors/warnings will be listed in the preview window.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Viewer Customization                                         *ls_11_7* *ls_a_dE*
                                                           *customizing-viewing*

The following settings affect how Latex-Suite will display compiled files.



g:Tex_ViewRule_<format>                                    *ls_11_7_1* *ls_a_dF*
                                                           *Tex_ViewRule_format*

Here <format> refers to a format such as dvi, ps, etc. This variable defines the
program which will be called to display a file of that format.

By default, Latex-Suite defines viewer programs for viewing DVI, PS and PDF
formats as follows:

                      Windows       Unix~
g:Tex_ViewRule_dvi    'yap -1'      'xdvi'
g:Tex_ViewRule_ps     'gsview32'    'ghostview'
g:Tex_ViewRule_pdf    'AcroRd32'    'xpdf'

For Macintosh systems, these strings are left empty by default. This lets the
system pick the program for each format. If you define these variables for Mac,
the system choice will be over-ridden.

Latex-Suite appends file.format to the above settings while calling the external
programs. For example, with  >
    let g:Tex_ViewRule_dvi = 'yap -1'
yap is called as  >
    !start yap -1 file.dvi
from within Vim. (The initial start is used on Windows platforms is to make yap
start as a separate process.) If you find the way Latex-Suite constructs the
command line too restrictive, you can use the Tex_ViewRuleComplete_format
[|ls_a_dG|] setting for more complete control on how the command line is
constructed while calling the external program for viewing.

NOTE: For windows, you will need to set the $PATH variable to include the paths
      to yap, AcroRd32, gsview32 and any other programs. See your system
      documentation for how to do this.
      
      
NOTE: Default Viewing Format
      ----------------------
      To change the default format for viewing files, set the
      g:Tex_DefaultTargetFormat [|ls_a_dw|] variable.
      
      


Tex_ViewRuleComplete_<format>                              *ls_11_7_2* *ls_a_dG*
                                                   *Tex_ViewRuleComplete_format*

Here <format> refers to the extension of a output format such as dvi, html etc.

Tex_ViewRuleComplete_format takes precedence over Tex_ViewRule_format if both
are specified. By default, Latex-Suite does not define values for
Tex_ViewRuleComplete_format for any format. Unlike in the case of
Tex_ViewRule_format, Latex-Suite does not modify Tex_ViewRuleComplete_format at
all in constructing the command line. The only modification is to substitute
'$*' everywhere in the string with the name of the file being viewed (without
the extension).

NOTE: IMPORTANT
      ---------
      Make sure you make the process go into the background otherwise vim will
      wait for the viewer to terminate before letting you edit the file again.
      
      To make a process go into the background on a *nix platform, use a
      trailing & in the setting. On Windows, use start at the beginning of the
      setting. Example: Suppose you have a latex->html converter which converts
      a file say foo.tex to a file foo/index.html. Then you would use:  >
          " On *nix platform
          let g:Tex_ViewRuleComplete_html = 'MozillaFirebird $*/index.html &'
          " On windows platform
          let g:Tex_ViewRuleComplete_html = 'start MozillaFirebird $*/index.html'
<     
      
      

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Menu Customization                                           *ls_11_8* *ls_a_dH*
                                                             *customizing-menus*

In addition to using the variables defined in this section to affect the
menu-layout permanently (i.e, the layout Latex-Suite will start with), you can
also use the TeX-Suite > Configure Menu menu to dynamically configure the menu
layout after Latex-Suite has started.



g:Tex_Menus                                                *ls_11_8_1* *ls_a_dI*
                                                                     *Tex_Menus*


Type             Boolean
Default Value    1

If set to 0, Latex-Suite will suppress showing all menus. Useful if you mostly
work in terminals.


g:Tex_MainMenuLocation                                     *ls_11_8_2* *ls_a_dJ*
                                                          *Tex_MainMenuLocation*


Type             number
Default Value    80

This setting decides the location of the first top-level Latex-Suite menu. You
can for example shift all the menus created by Latex-Suite to the very end by
setting this value to a large number like 990.


g:Tex_MathMenus                                            *ls_11_8_3* *ls_a_dK*
                                                                 *Tex_MathMenus*


Type             Boolean
Default Value    1

The Tex-Math menu consists of hundreds of mathematical symbols used in LaTeX.
This menu comprises about 75% of the menus.


g:Tex_NestElementMenus                                     *ls_11_8_4* *ls_a_dL*
                                                          *Tex_NestElementMenus*


Type             Boolean
Default Value    1

This setting controls the "compactness" of the menus. If set to 1, then the
Font, Counter and Dimensioning menus are collected together in a single menu
called Tex-Elements, otherwise, they will each get a separate menu.


g:Tex_PackagesMenu                                         *ls_11_8_5* *ls_a_dM*
                                                              *Tex_PackagesMenu*


Type             Boolean
Default Value    1

Setting this to zero will stop Latex-Suite from automatically creating the
TeX-Suite > Packages > Supported menu at startup. You can still create the menu
after startup by going to TeX-Suite > Configure Menu.


g:Tex_NestPackagesMenu                                     *ls_11_8_6* *ls_a_dN*
                                                          *Tex_NestPackagesMenu*


Type             String
Default Value    'TeX-'

This string is the prefix added to all the menus created by Latex-Suite. If you
define this variable with a dot ('.') as the last character, then all the menus
created by Latex-Suite will be nested under a single master menu. For example,
set this to '&LaTeX-Suite.' to nest all menus under a menu called &LaTeX-Suite.


g:Tex_UseUtfMenus                                          *ls_11_8_7* *ls_a_dO*
                                                               *Tex_UseUtfMenus*


Type             Boolean
Default Value    0

This setting controls whether Latex-Suite uses utf-8 symbols to display some of
the mathematical symbols in the TeX-Math menu. It is necessary for your
system/GUI to support utf-8. Setting this to 1 has the side-effect of setting
the 'encoding' option of Vim to 'utf-8'.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Folding Customization                                        *ls_11_9* *ls_a_dP*
                                                           *customizing-folding*

The following settings control the folding [|ls_a_ci|] functionality of
Latex-Suite.



g:Tex_Folding                                              *ls_11_9_1* *ls_a_dQ*
                                                                   *Tex_Folding*


Type             Boolean
Default Value    1

Setting this to zero completely disables Latex-Suite's folding functionality.
However, the TexFoldTextFunction() is still available in case you want to use
another folding scheme but still want to continue using the fold text function.


g:Tex_AutoFolding                                          *ls_11_9_2* *ls_a_dR*
                                                               *Tex_AutoFolding*


Type             Boolean
Default Value    1

This setting controls whether Latex-Suite automatically creates manual folds for
a file when it is opened. You can still use the \rf mapping to refresh/create
folds even when this variable is set to zero.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package Handling Customization                              *ls_11_10* *ls_a_dS*
                                                          *customizing-packages*

These settings affect the custom packages [|ls_a_bN|] functionality in
Latex-Suite



g:Tex_TEXINPUTS                                           *ls_11_10_1* *ls_a_dT*
                                                                 *Tex_TEXINPUTS*


Type             string
Default Value    ''

This setting describes the directories scanned by Latex-Suite while searching
for custom user packages as described in the custom packages [|ls_a_bN|]
section. Do not include the present directory in this setting. The present
directory is always scanned for custom packages.

This string should be set in the syntax accepted by Vim's native 'path' setting.

                       in Latex-Suite.
Gergely Kontra         the clever little JumpFunc() in imaps.vim is due to him.
                       The implementation of the templates also borrows from
                       mu-template.vim by him.
Dimitri Antoniou       author of ltags and also provided the nice tip about
                       forward / reverse search on DVI documents.
Stephen Riehm          the extremely helpful bracketing system is from him.
Alan Schmitt           provided macros/folding elements. Continued feedback,
                       bug-reports/fixes.
Hari Krishna Dara      for ExecMap(), the clever little function which makes
                       typing visual mode mappings so much easier and error-free.
Alan G Isac            for the comprehensive BibT() function for entering bibtex
                       entries.
Gontran Baerts         for libList.vim
Peter Heslin           useful discussion and also a lot of bug fixes. the
                       %%fakesection in folding.vim.
Zhang Lin-bo           lots of very useful additions to folding. The code for
                       customizing the folding scheme is due to him.

A large number of functions in Latex-Suite come from various other people. Some
of those people might have been missed here. Each function should however have
the author's name/e-mail above it. Thats the more authoritative place to check
out who has done what.

About this file

This file was created automatically from its XML variant using db2vim. db2vim is
a python script which understands a very limited subset of the Docbook XML 4.2
DTD and outputs a plain text file in vim help format.

db2vim can be obtained via anonymous CVS from sourceforge.net. Use

cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.vim-latex.sf.net:/cvsroot/vim-latex co db2vim

Or you can visit the web-interface to sourceforge CVS at:
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/vim-latex/db2vim/

The following modelines should nicely fold up this help manual.
